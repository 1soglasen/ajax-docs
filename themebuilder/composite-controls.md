# Composite Controls 



When working with complex controls (e.g. RadGrid) the nested components will be included automatically. Thus, you can easily configure the complete look and feel of the composite control.

Note that if one of the nested controls is used separately on the page you should set its **Skin** explicitly. To use a custom skin you should also ensure that the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property is set to **false**.
