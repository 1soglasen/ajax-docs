# List Items Scenario



## 

Most of the Office SharePoint Server features are represented as lists. For example, __Blogs__, __announcements__, etc. You can easily replace the editor in these cases with the RadEditor.

>note  __NOTE:__ Once the RadEditor for SharePoint 2010 features are activated they will affect only the current site. You need to activate the RadEditor features for each site individually. If you want to change the scope of the features, see the following article -[Change the RadEditor features scope]({%slug moss/sharepoint-2010/radeditor-web-part/configuration/change-the-radeditor-features-scope%})

1. From the __Site Actions__ menu go to __Site Settings__

4. __IMPORTANT!__ If you still see the default editor or a simple textbox after you activate the RadEditor feature(s), you might need to open a command prompt window and type __iisreset__ to reset the Internet Information Server. This will prevent problems caused by caching.

This screenshot below shows RadEditor used to edit a Task description.
