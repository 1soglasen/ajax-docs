# MOSSTemplateManager





By using the __MOSSTemplateManager__tool the users can add items from the __Reusable Content__ list to the content of __RadEditor for MOSS__. When the user clicks the MOSSTemplateManager toolbar button the standard __Select Reusable Content Web Page__ dialog box opens and displays the contents of the __Reusable Content__list. Here the user can browse the list for the item that he wants to add.

## Usage in different scenarios:

* Web Content Management scenario – This is the case when the user uses __RadEditor for MOSS__ to edit content that is contained by a Page Content field control. Here the user can benefit from the full functionality of __MOSS Reusable Content__ and most important the __Automatic Update__ feature.

* WebPart and List Items – Since the Reusable Content functionality is not available in the out of the box Html Editor in such scenarios, the __MOSSTemplateManager__ tool of __RadEditor for MOSS__ can only be used as a plain HTML template manager. Here the __Automatic Update__ feature is not available.



## Browser compatibility issues:

The __MOSSTemplateManager__toolbar button opens the standard Select Reusable Content Web Page dialog. This dialog however is not compatible with FireFox.
