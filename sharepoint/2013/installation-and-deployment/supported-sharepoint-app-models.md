# Supported SharePoint App Models



## 

The SharePoint 2013 Apps are divided into several types, depending on where they are hosted. The following list contains information about each type and whether Telerik® UI for ASP.NET Ajax support it:

* **Provider-hosted (supported)** - Developer or IT department provides the hosting structure for the application, so there is no limitation for the technology that can be used, including Telerik® UI for ASP.NET Ajax.

* **Autohosted (supported)** - The application is hosted in Windows Azure. In general Telerik® UI for ASP.NET Ajax support Azure.

* **SharePoint-hosted(not supported)** - This kind of app lives entirely in the client’s SharePoint environment and it is limited to using only HTML andJavaScript. Telerik® UI for ASP.NET Ajax depend on server rendering, so this scenario is not supported.

More information on SharePoint app model can be found in [this MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/apps/fp179930%28v=office.15%29).
