# Change the RadEditor features scope



## 

Q: How do I change the scope of the RadEditor features so they can be activated from the Site Collection features.

A: You need to remove the features, change their scope, and finally install them again. First open a command prompt on the server and execute the following commands to remove the features:

C:\>__stsadm -o uninstallfeature -name RadEditorFeatureRichHtml -force__

Operation completed successfully.

C:\>__stsadm -o uninstallfeature -name RadEditorFeatureRichText -force__

Operation completed successfully.

Then open the feature definition files and change the scope attribute from "Web" to "Site". The files you need to edit are:

__C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\RadEditorFeatureRichHtml\Feature.xml__

and

__C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\RadEditorFeatureRichText\Feature.xml__

Open them with a text editor and change the line:

__Scope="Web"__

to

__Scope="Site"__

Save the changed .xml files and install the features again:

C:\>__stsadm -o installfeature -name RadEditorFeatureRichHtml -force__

Operation completed successfully.

C:\>__stsadm -o installfeature -name RadEditorFeatureRichText -force__

Operation completed successfully.
