# Inserting Flash and Media files in RadEditor



## 

__Web Part and WCM scenario__

You need to modify the __ToolsFile.xml__ which is located in the following folder:

/Program Files/Common Files/Microsoft Shared/web server extensions/wpresources/RadEditorSharePoint/5.x.x.0__1f131a624888eeed/Resources/

and add the following tools:

````XML
	    <tool name="FlashManager" />
	    <tool name="MediaManager" />
````



>caution in the WCM scenario you will also need to add / set the __AllowSpecialTags__ property to true. You can set it in the current page using SharePoint Designer.[Click here]({%slug sharepoint/2007/radeditor-for-moss/configuration/setting-configfile-and-toolsfile-properties-for-the-wcm-field%})for more information
>


__SharePoint forms scenario (Lists, Wikis, Blogs, etc.)__

You cannot enter Media / Flash files in such scenarios. There RadEditor does not have control over the presentation view which means that we cannot control the output when it is not in edit mode.
