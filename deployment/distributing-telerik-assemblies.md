# Distributing Telerik UI Assemblies

The Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite includes a limited, run time, royalty-free license to redistribute the controls in your own solutions subject to the License Agreement. You can use the components within the suite to build your own solutions, and redistribute your solutions to your end users who are not required to purchase their own license from Telerik to access your solution.


## Examples of Permitted Uses

* ASP.NET AJAX applications for internal company use.

* Commercial ASP.NET AJAX applications deployed to Your end users. In this case, you may deploy the Telerik assemblies together with your application __with the sole exception of the *Telerik.Web.Design.dll* assembly. The *Telerik.Web.Design.dll* assembly may not be deployed to end-users under any circumstances.__

* ASP.NET AJAX applications that offer a trial or free version of Your application. **If offering a free or trial version of Your Integrated Product, redistribution of the assemblies is not permitted. You are required to protect all Telerik assemblies using the approach outlined in the [Protecting the Telerik ASP.NET AJAX Assembly]({%slug introduction/deployment/protecting-the-telerik-asp.net-ajax-assembly%}) article.**



## Examples of Uses Requiring Telerik Review
