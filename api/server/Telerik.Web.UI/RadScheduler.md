# Telerik.Web.UI.RadScheduler

Using the Telerik RadScheduler control, you can build powerful ASP.NET 
            applications to allow users to create and manage tasks. RadScheduler displays
            and edits scheduled appointments that are stored in a separate data source. A variety
            of data binding options allows you to work with data sources that 
            are as simple or as powerful as you want.

                The properties can be set declaratively using one of the following methods:Place an attribute in the opening tag of the Telerik RadScheduler
                    control in the form Property-Subproperty, where Subproperty is a property of
                    the SchedulerExportSettings object (for example,
