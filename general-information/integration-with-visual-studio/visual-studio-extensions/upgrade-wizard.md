# Upgrade Wizard



## 

An important feature in the Telerik Visual Studio Extensions is the **Project Upgrade Wizard**. It can facilitate the process of upgrading the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX to the latest version in your project.

To start the Upgrade Wizard go to **Telerik** > **UI for ASP.NET AJAX** > **Upgrade Wizard** in the Visual Studio menu.

On the first screen of the wizard is described what will be upgraded:

In addition to the pure assembly reference change, the Upgrade Wizard provides several important features:

* Check and retrieve the latest available **Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX** release;

* Change the version of **Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX** the project uses.

On the next step the wizard lists all projects from the solution, which use Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX.You can choose which projects will be updated (it is recommended to upgrade all projects to the chosen version),the version which they will be upgraded to and whether or not all binaries should get copied to your solution folder(useful when utilizing a build server or working on a project collaboratively):

>note The listed projects target .NET Framework 4.5. If the solution contains any projects which have different target framework, they will be displayed on a separate page. When you complete the wizard all selected projects from the different pages will be updated.
>


>note The **Add referenced assemblies to solution** option is not available for Visual Studio web site projects or when using GAC based distributions.
>


The following page of the upgrade wizard suggests you three options for the project resources:

>note 
* In case *non-embedded*  **Skins** and/or **Scripts** folders are detected in the root of a project selected for upgrade they will be automatically updated in accordance with the selected controls version.>

The next screen allows you to update the Visual Studio ToolBox with the newly selected controls, so that you avoid accidental reference change during a control drag and drop:

The last step suggest you to create a backup of your projects:

After choosing the preferred options and pressing the Finish button, the Upgrade Wizard will replace the existing assemblies in the selected project(s) with the ones from the selected distribution. The wizard will update only assemblies that are currently referenced, e.g. it won't add references to newly introduced assemblies.

>important The Upgrade Wizard will add a reference to Telerik.Web.UI.Skins if the following conditions are met:
>
* The source project references Telerik assemblies with version lower than Q3 2011
* The target distribution version is greater than Q3 2011
* Telerik.Web.UI.Skins is not referenced>


The reason for the described exception is the displacement of the embedded skins from Telerik.Web.UI to Telerik.Web.UI.Skins, introduced with the Q3 2011 release.

>note 
* The Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX distribution selection screen lists all the versions that can be detected automatically. These are versions, installed by using the Windows Installer MSI package (marked with **[Install Folder]** ), versions, downloaded earlier by the Upgrade Wizard (marked with **[Download]** ) and versions, available in the GAC (marked with **[GAC]** ). Hotfixes, downloaded manually cannot be detected. You could use the **Browse** button to navigate to the **Telerik.Web.UI** assembly of a manually downloaded version.
* The Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX version signature is defined by the year, number of Q, month, day and .NET Framework version of the release. For example version 2012.1.215 means Q1 2012, which is released on February 15, 2012. In addition to this signature, you will find an indication whether the release is a trial ( **Trial** ) or purchased ( **Dev** ) version.
* The distribution, downloaded by the Upgrade Wizard contains only the "hotfix" files, e.g. the barebone files, needed for a project to run correctly. It does not contain the documentation or the Live Examples.
* A Visual Studio restart will be required in order to update your toolbox. If the automatic restart fails, a restart should be initiated manually in order to complete the toolbox upgrade.>
