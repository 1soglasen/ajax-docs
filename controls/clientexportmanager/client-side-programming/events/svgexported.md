# SvgExported



The client-side __SvgExported__ event is raised when the svg is already exported by __RadClientExportManager__.

To handle this event, simply write a JavaScript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of this function as the value of the the __SvgExported__ property.

## 

The client-side __SvgExported__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. Sender—the [RadClientExportManager object]({%slug clientexportmanager/client-side-programming/overview%}) that fired the event.

1. Event arguments—a __ClientExportManagerSvgExportedEventArgs__ object.
