__RadMap__ for ASP.NET AJAX is a mobile friendly control that works on wide screens as well as on smaller screens. The control has by design a lightweight rendering that is based on the latest web technology (i.e., HTML5 and CSS3).

__RadMap__ is also adapted to touch device gestures like tap, drag, spread and pinch. More information is available in [Gestures Support]({%slug map/mobile-support/gestures-support%}) help article.
