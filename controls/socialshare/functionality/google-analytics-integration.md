# Google Analytics Integration



## 

The __RadSocialShare__ control offers full Google Analytics support which can be enabled by setting a single property -__GoogleAnalyticsUA__ to web property ID (also known as UA number).

Key features:

* Asynchronous implementation

* Multi trackers support

* Having more than one __RadSocialShare__ instances with the same UA will all be logged in the same tracker instead of overidding each other
