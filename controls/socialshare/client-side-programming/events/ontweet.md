# OnTweet



## 

__OnTweet__ - fires when the Tweet button is clicked in the sharing popup (i.e. after the actual tweet is posted). Does not fire immediately after the Tweet Standard button is clicked in the RadSocialShare control. Scripts from Twitter return the information about this event and its behavior cannot be changed.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. sender - the __RadSocialShare__ instance that fired the event.

1. eventArgs - event arguments. It exposes the get_url() method that returns the shared URL.
