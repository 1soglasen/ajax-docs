# SocialShare Overview



## 

The __RadSocialShare__ is a control that allows you to easily connect your site with the __popular social networks__ or let the user send an __e-mail__ with the link. It creates a centralized bar in which you can choose in which networks your users will be able to share the content. You are also allowed to make only a handful of the buttons visible initially and place the rest in a popup with a search box.![socialshare-overview](images/socialshare-overview.png)

Key features:

* Easy [customization of the content the user shares]({%slug socialshare/functionality/controlling-posts%})

* The current page or custom URL

* The developer can preset the title of the post the user will share, this overriding the page's title / URL

* Two types of sharing buttons:

* [ Styled buttons ]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/styled%}) - by default provide consistent look, size and icons for the most popular features of the social networks, yet can be fully customized in terms of size, icon, text and tooltip

* [ Standard buttons ]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/standard%}) - they are rendered by the social networks themselves and provide their full functionality

* [Two buttons collections]({%slug socialshare/configuring-buttons/collections%}) to fully customize the look and feel of the control

* __Main Buttons__ - these are always shown on the page and the social network is only a click away

* __Compact Buttons__ - If you do not want to overload the page with buttons deemed as rarely used you can leave the rest in a popup that gets opened viathe RadCompactButton.

* [Visual Button Configurator]({%slug socialshare/design-time%}) that allows you toconfigure the button collections quickly and without writing a single line of code

* Ability to [send the URL as an e-mail]({%slug socialshare/functionality/sending-via-e-mail%})

* Via the __default mail client from the user's machine__, thus from the user's own account

* Via a __built-in mail form__ that sends the e-mail on behalf of the user from an address and server declared by the developer

* Easy [integration with Google Analytics]({%slug socialshare/functionality/google-analytics-integration%})

* [Client-side events]({%slug socialshare/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) which allow you to thank the user or prevent multiple clicks

* The popular [Telerik skinning mechanism]({%slug socialshare/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to match the rest of the site
