## Known issues

Pinterest Standard Buttons are created via external scripts from their network and therefore we cannotfully guarantee their correct functionality.

__Visual appearance issues__

* The 'Cancel' button of the PinPageImage looks distorted under IE7.

* The horizontal counter bubble is not shown when the count equals to 0.

* The "+" sign, when present, is displayed below the horizontal bubble counter under Opera.

__JavaScript errors__

* Standard button PinPageImage expects to have at least one image on the page. If no images are present on the page,the Pinterestâ€™s javascript file throws an error in the console (e.g. *	NotFoundError:	Node was not found*).

* When a Pinterest user profile is opened, a JavaScript error is thrown in different browsers (e.g. *	FireFox: TypeError: boardContainer[0] is undefined;	Chrome: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'offsetTop' of undefined;	IE: SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'offsetTop': object is null or undefined*).
