__RadTabStrip__ introduces three server-side events for working with tabs:

* [TabClick]({%slug tabstrip/server-side-programming/tabclick%}) occurs when the user clicks on a tab.

* [TabCreated]({%slug tabstrip/server-side-programming/tabcreated%}) occurs when a new tab is added to the tab strip (at any level).

* [TabDataBound]({%slug tabstrip/server-side-programming/tabdatabound%}) occurs when a tab is bound to a data source.

* [Reordered]({%slug tabstrip/server-side-programming/reordered%}) occurs after the reorder operation is completed.

In addition, __RadMultiPage__ introduces a single server-side event:

* [PageViewCreated]({%slug tabstrip/server-side-programming/pageviewcreated-%}) occurs when a new page view is added to the multi-page.
