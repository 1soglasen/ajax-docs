# RadGauge Structure



The basic structure of the __RadGauge__, regardless of its type (Radial or Linear) cosists of a __Scale__	and a __Pointer__ that shows the value on that scale. The scale contains the Major and Minor __Ticks__ that mark the values,	along with the __Labels__ for them. In the scale the developer can define separate __Ranges__	in order to colorize them differently. The __Pointer__ has a __Cap__ (Radial) or __Track__ (Linear)	that allow for customizing its appearance.

The sections and images below show these elements on simple gauges for visual clarity.
