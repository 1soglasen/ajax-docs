# TaskDelete



The __RadGantt TaskDelete__ is fired when a task's collection is about to be deleted from the database through the provider.

__TaskDelete__ event handler receives two parameters:

* __sender__ is the __RadGantt__ control instance.

* __e__ is an object of type __GanttEventArgs__. It gives you access to the deleted __RadGantt__ tasks collection.

## Example

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadGantt ID="RadGantt1" runat="server" OnTaskDelete="RadGantt1_TaskDelete"></telerik:RadGantt>
````

````C#
	    protected void RadGantt1_TaskDelete(object sender, Telerik.Web.UI.Gantt.GanttEventArgs e)
	    {
	        foreach (var item in e.Tasks)
	        {
	            //...
