# ColumnCreated



The __RadGantt ColumnCreated__ is fired after a [TreeList]({%slug gantt/structure/layout%}) column was created.

__ColumnCreated__ event handler receives two parameters:

* __sender__ is the __RadGantt__ control instance.

* __e__ is an object of type __ColumnCreatedEventArgs__. It gives you access to the created [TreeList]({%slug gantt/structure/layout%}) column.

## Example

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadGantt ID="RadGantt1" runat="server" OnColumnCreated="RadGantt1_ColumnCreated"></telerik:RadGantt>
````





````C#
	    protected void RadGantt1_ColumnCreated(object sender, Telerik.Web.UI.Gantt.ColumnCreatedEventArgs e)
	    {
	        //...
	    }
````
````VB.NET
	    Protected Sub RadGantt1_ColumnCreated(sender As Object, e As Gantt.ColumnCreatedEventArgs)
	        '...
	    End Sub
````
