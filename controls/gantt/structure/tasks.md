* **Summary** - a grouping of child tasks. The **Summary** has a **Start** and **End** determined by the earliest **Start** and latest **End** of its child tasks. The percentage of completion is calculated based on the percentage of each child task. The **Summary** does not have links to predecessors, and can not be referenced as such by other tasks.
