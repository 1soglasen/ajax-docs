# Mobile Support Overview



## 

__Telerik RadGantt__ comes with built-in adaptive behavior. When accessed via a mobile device, the control changes to create a user experience tailored to the device screen size. In this mode, __RadGantt__ is mobile-friendly and its features are easier to select and interact.

The Gantt control for ASP.NET AJAX makes possible to handle touch events in the same manner as those triggered by a keyboard or a mouse.

## Mobile vs Auto Render Modes

You can enable the mobile layout of the control by setting the __RenderMode__ property of the Gantt to __Mobile__.

To cover the rendering of both mobile and desktop devices, you can set the __RenderMode__ property to __Auto__. This option will automatically decide how to render the control on a smartphone, tablet or PC.

For more accurate device detection, you can reference the [Device Detection Framework](www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/device-detection-framework.aspx) , which ensures that the control is rendered with appropriate UI according to the device screen size.
