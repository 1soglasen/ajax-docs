# Changes and Backward Compatibility


## RadCloudUpload for ASP.NET AJAX Q1 2017

As from Q1 2017, the RadCloudUpload is internally referencing version 3 of the Amazon SDK for .NET. Hence, you will be able to use all new features that come with this version. The version 3 of the AWS SDK for .NET uses separate packages (dlls) for each service. The RadCloudUpload only references [AWSSDK.Core.dll](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.Core/) and [AWSSDK.S3.dll](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.S3/). 
For more information on how to use old version of the Amazon SDK with the RadCloudUpload, refer to this [documentation article]({%slug cloudupload/how-to/using-amazonsdk-version2%})
