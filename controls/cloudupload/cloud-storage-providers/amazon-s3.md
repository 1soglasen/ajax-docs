## Adding References

To upload files in Amazon S3(or Amazon Simple Storage Service) __RadCloudUpload__ depends on the [AWS SDK for .NET](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/). This package can be installed from [NuGet Repository](http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK/) via the __Package Management Console__ with the following command:

__Install-Package AWSSDK -Version 1.5.45__ - for Telerik.Web.UI version 2013.3.1324 or earlier.

__Install-Package AWSSDK -Version 2.0.5__ - for Telerik.Web.UI version 2014.1.XXXX or later.![cloudupload-amazon-nuget](images/cloudupload-amazon-nuget.png)

>note The package management tool will add the __AWSSDK.dll__ assembly.
>When Web Application is used the Copy Local property in the Reference Properties dialog box, available from the References pane of the Project Designer must be set to __True__ .

## Configuration

__RadCloudUpload__ supports file uploading in Amazon S3. Configuration requires to set __Access Key__, __Secret Key__ and __Bucket Name__.

1. From __RadCloudUpload__'s smart tag choose Amazon as provider tag and open the __Configuration Wizard__:

1. In the __Configuration Wizard__ dialog enter Amazon S3 __Access Key__, __Secret Key__ and __Bucket Name__. ![cloudupload-amazon-s 3-configuration](images/cloudupload-amazon-s3-configuration.png)Specifying the __Uncommitted Files Expiration Period__(TimeSpan Structure), you could easily configure the time, after which the unprocessed files will be removed from the storage.When __Ensure Container__ is checked, the control will create a new Bucket if it doesn't exist. In case it is not checked and the Bucket doesn't exist - an exception will be thrown.This will add configuration setting in the __web.config__ file:

````XML
	            <telerik.web.ui>
	                <radCloudUpload>
	                    <storageProviders>
	                        <add name="Amazon" type="Telerik.Web.UI.AmazonS3Provider" accessKey="" secretKey="" bucketName="" uncommitedFilesExpirationPeriod="2" />
	                    </storageProviders>
	                </radCloudUpload>
	            </telerik.web.ui>
````



>caution Uploading files in Amazon S3 is performed in chunks. Default chunk size defined by Amazon is 5 MB. Because the default ASP.NET size request is 4MB, you must increase it, in order to avoid errors. This can be done by increasing the value of[MaxRequestLength]({%slug cloudupload/application-scenarios/uploading-large-files%})property. Chunks which are not uploaded will be removed automatically by __RadCloudUpload__ .
