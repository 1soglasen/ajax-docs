# Advanced via NeedDataSource



## 

The key to the advanced data binding of a __RadPivotGrid__ control is handling the__NeedDataSource__ event. __RadPivotGrid__ fires the __NeedDataSource__event each time it needs to be bound to a data source. If, at the time of the event, the __DataSource__ propertyis not set to a valid data source object, the pivot grid will not behave correctly.

This event fires in the following cases:

* Right after __OnLoad__, Telerik RadTreeList checks the ViewState for stored TreeList-related information. If such informationis missing (when the page loads for the first time), the __NeedDataSource__ event is fired. This also means that if the__EnableViewState__ property of the control has been set to false, the treelist will bind e__ach time the page loads__(not only the first time).

* When a paging operation occurs.

* When a sorting operation occurs.

* After expand/collapse.

* When other operations requiring Rebind occurs.

The advantage of using the __NeedDataSource__ event is that you have the flexibility of generatingyour data source in the code-behind, but are freed from handling the logic of when and how data-binding should take place.It is still your responsibility to properly construct a data source object and assign it to the pivotgrid's__DataSource__ property.

>caution  __Important:__ You should never call the __Rebind__ () method in a __NeedDataSource__ event handler.You should never call __DataBind__ () as well when	using advanced data-binding through __NeedDataSource__ .
>


__RadPivotGrid__ does not fire the __NeedDataSource__ event unless it is visible(__Visible__=__True__).

In a __NeedDataSource__ event handler, you should prepare the data source(list of objects) for RadPivotGrid and assign it to the pivotgrid's __DataSource__ property:
