# Localization



## 

The __RadFileExplorer__control uses the same localization mechanism as RadEditor (.resx files in the __App_GlobalResources__folder). If you want to change the localization strings, you need to copy the __RadEditor.Dialogs.resx__file in the __App_GlobalResources__folder of your application and edit the strings inside.
