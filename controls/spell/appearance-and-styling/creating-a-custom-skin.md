# Creating a Custom Skin



## 

Each of the controls included in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite is styled with two CSS files that are loaded in a certain order. The first one - __ControlName.css__, also called base stylesheet contains CSS properties and values that are common for all skins, i.e it is layout-specific, not skin-specific. These are CSS float, padding, margin, font-size, font-family, etc. In the general case, when creating a custom skin for a control this file should not be edited, unless the custom skin needs different sizes, padding and/ or margins.

The second file represents the actual skin of the control, and its name consists of the control name plus the skin name, e.g. - __Rating.Default.css__. Upon creating a custom skin for the control, one should edit that particular file, as it contains skin-specific CSS properties, and references to images, colors, borders and backgrounds.

Unlike the rest of the controls, __RadSpell__, however uses only one CSS file â€“ __Spell.css__. This is so because __RadSpell__ consists of two controls from Telerik AJAX Web UI Suite: __RadFormDecorator__and __RadWidnow__.Each one of these controls is styled with two CSS files that are loaded in a certain order.
