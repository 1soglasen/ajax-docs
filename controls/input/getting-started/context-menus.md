* __Cut__: Cuts the selected text to the clipboard.

* __Copy__: Copies the selected text to the clipboard.

* __Paste__: Pastes the text in the clipboard, replacing the current selection or, if there is no selected text, inserting it at the cursor.

* __Delete__: Deletes the currently selected text.
