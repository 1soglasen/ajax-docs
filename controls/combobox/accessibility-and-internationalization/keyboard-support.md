# Keyboard Support



## 

**RadCombobox** provides support for the two relevant aspects of keyboard support:

* **Access Keys** - You can specify a key that lets the end-user move focus directly to the combobox. Once focus is on the combobox, the user can use the arrow keys for navigation. The access key is defined using the **AccessKey** property. For example, if you set the **AccessKey** property to "W", focus moves to the combobox when the user types "Alt+W".

* **Key Navigation**- RadComboBox allows end-users to navigate the combobox structure using the arrow keys and the Space and Enter keys:

* The up and down arrow keys change the current item in the drop-down list, updating the input area with the next item in the corresponding direction.

* The "Alt + Up" and "Alt+Down" arrows open and close the drop-down list.

* The "Enter" key selects the current item in the list.

* **ChangeTextOnKeyBoardNavigation** boolean property determines whether combobox will change its text in the input area when you scroll down the items with the keyboard.
