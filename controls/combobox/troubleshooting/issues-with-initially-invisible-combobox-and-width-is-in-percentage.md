````XML
	    <telerik:radcombobox 
	        id="RadComboBox1" 
	        runat="server" 
	        label="label"
	        width="50%">
	    </telerik:radcombobox>
````



Call the __repaint()__ method of the ComboBox client-side object to resolve the issue after you show it or its invisible container for the first time.

Clicks on the input of a ComboBox pass through the containing IFrame (RadWindow) into the owner document

You can resolve the issue by calling comboBox.__repaint()__ after you show the ComboBox. The most common case of this issue is when the ComboBox is in a RadWindow.
