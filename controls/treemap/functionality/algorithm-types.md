# Algorithm Types



The following article demonstrates the usage and the benefits of the __AlgorithmType__ property of the __RadTreeMap__

## 

The __AlgorithmType__ property of the __RadTreeMap__ is used to specify how the underlying data of the control should be visualized. The property accepts one of the following three values:

* __Horizontal__ - the __TreeMapItems__ are displayed side by side, having the same height as their parent Item. (see Figure 1)

* __Squarified__ - the area bellow the parent __TreeMapItem__ is subdivided into square rectangles, which size represents their ratio.(see Figure 2)

* __Vertical__ -the __TreeMapItems__ are displayed one below the other, having the same width as their parent Item.(see Figure 3)

__Figure 1__: Demonstrates how the __RadTreeMap__ is visualized, when __AlgorithmType__ is set to Horizontal.![functionality-algorythmtype-horizontal](images/functionality-algorythmtype-horizontal.png)

__Figure 2__: Demonstrates how the __RadTreeMap__ is visualized, when __AlgorithmType__ is set to Squarified.![functionality-algorythmtype-squarified](images/functionality-algorythmtype-squarified.png)

__Figure 3__: Demonstrates how the __RadTreeMap__ is visualized, when __AlgorithmType__ is set to Vertical.![functionality-algorythmtype-vertical](images/functionality-algorythmtype-vertical.png)
