# AppointmentDelete



The __AppointmentDelete__ event occurs just before the scheduler calls its data source to delete an appointment.

__AppointmentDelete__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler control.

* __e__ is an object of type __SchedulerCancelEventArgs__. It has two properties:

* __Appointment__ is the appointment that is about to be deleted.

* __Cancel__ is a boolean value that lets you prevent the deletion.

## Example





````C#
	
	    protected void RadScheduler1_AppointmentDelete(object sender, SchedulerCancelEventArgs e)
	    {
	        if (e.Appointment.Attributes["ReadOnly"] == "true")
	        {
	            e.Cancel = true;
	        }
	    } 
	
````
````VB.NET
	
	    Protected Sub RadScheduler1_AppointmentDelete(ByVal sender As Object, _
	       ByVal e As SchedulerCancelEventArgs) Handles RadScheduelr1.AppointmentDelete
	        If e.Appointment.Attributes("ReadOnly") = "true" Then
	            e.Cancel = True
	        End If
	    End Sub
