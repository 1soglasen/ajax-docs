# AppointmentCommand



The __AppointmentCommand__ event occurs when the user clicks any button in the appointment template. This event is typically used to handle button controls with a custom CommandName value.

__AppointmentCommand__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler that contains the appointment with the button the user clicked.

* __e__ is an object of type __AppointmentCommandEventArgs__. It has three properties:

* __CommandName__ is the __CommandName__ attribute of the button that was clicked.

* __CommandArgument__ is the __CommandArgument__ attribute of the button that was clicked.

* __Container__ is an object of type __SchedulerAppointmentContainer__ that represents the appointment in the scheduler.
