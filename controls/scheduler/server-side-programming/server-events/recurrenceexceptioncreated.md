# RecurrenceExceptionCreated





The __RecurrenceExceptionCreated__ event occurs when the user creates an exception in a recurrent series. __RecurrenceExceptionCreated__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler control.

* __e__ is an object of type __RecurrenceExceptionCreatedEventArgs__.It has four properties:- __Appointment__- the master appointment;- __ExceptionAppointment__- the newly created exception appointment;- __OccurenceAppointment__- the original occurrencebefore the exception was created;- __Cancel__ is a boolean value that lets you prevent the creation of the exception;

## Example
