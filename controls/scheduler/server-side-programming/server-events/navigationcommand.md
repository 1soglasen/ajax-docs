# NavigationCommand



The __NavigationCommand__ occurs when the user clicks on a control that changes the selected day, view, or mode of the scheduler.

__NavigationCommand__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler control.

* __e__ is an object of type __SchedulerNavigationCommandEventArgs__. It has three properties:

* __Command__ indicates what control the user clicked. Possible values are listed in the table below.

* __SelectedDay__ is a DateTime specifying the target date when __Command__ is __SchedulerNavigationCommand.SwitchToSelectedDay__.

* __Cancel__ is a boolean value that lets you prevent the scheduler from responding to the navigation command.

The __Command__ property is of type __SchedulerNavigationCommand__. This type has the following possible values:
