The __AppointmentCreated__ event occurs immediately after an appointment template is instantiated.

__AppointmentCreated__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler control.

* __e__ is an object of type __AppointmentCreatedEventArgs__.It has two properties:

* __Appointment__ is the appointment which representation is about to be shown.

* __Container__ is the representation template of the appointment.

You can use this event to modify the appointment template before data binding.

## Example

In this example, the appearance of the appointment is changed based on a custom attribute.A label is updated to show the value of the attribute, and the appointment style sheet is changedto customize the appearance of the appointment based on the attribute.
