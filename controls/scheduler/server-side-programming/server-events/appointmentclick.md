# AppointmentClick



The __AppointmentClick__ event occurs when the user clicks on an appointment and __RadScheduler__ is inReadOnly mode- either __ReadOnly="true"__ or __AllowEdit="false"__. You can use this event to perform additional actions when an appointment is clicked.

__AppointmentClick__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler that contains the appointment the user clicked.

* __e__ is an object of type __SchedulerEventArgs__. It has an Appointment property thatgives you access to the appointment that was clicked.

## Example

	    protected void RadScheduler1_AppointmentClick(object sender, SchedulerEventArgs e)
	    {
	        Response.Redirect("Page.aspx");
	    }  
	
````
