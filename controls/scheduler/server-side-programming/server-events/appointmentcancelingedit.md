# AppointmentCancelingEdit



The __AppointmentCancelingEdit__ event occurs when the user clicks the cancel button of the in-line editor or the edit form.

__AppointmentCancelingEdit__ has two parameters:

* __sender__ is the scheduler control.

* __e__ is an object of type __AppointmentCancelingEditEventArgs__. It has three properties:

* __Appointment__ is the appointment that was being inserted or updated by the editor.

* __Container__ is the editor that was being used to insert or edit an appointment.

* __Cancel__ is a boolean value that lets you prevent the user from exiting the edit form or in-line editor.
