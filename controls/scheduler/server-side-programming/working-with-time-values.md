# Working with Time Values



## 

Because the scheduler stores its time values using UTC, a little extra work is required when working with appointmenttimes programmatically.To help with this extra work, RadScheduler has a pair of methods for converting between the display time (as it appears inthe scheduler)and UTC (as the scheduler stores the date value). These methods are __DisplayToUtc__ and__UtcToDisplay__. Each takes a DateTime value as an argument and returns a converted DateTime value.

When adding appointments to the scheduler programmatically, you must converttime values to universal time sothat they willbe displayed properly:



>tabbedCode

````C#
	
	DateTime start = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime();
	DateTime end = start.AddHours(1);
	Appointment apt = new Appointment("1", start, end, "Do it now.");
	RadScheduler1.InsertAppointment(apt);  
				
````
````VB.NET
	
	    Dim start As DateTime = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime()
	    Dim [end] As DateTime = start.AddHours(1)
	    Dim apt As New Appointment("1", start, [end], "Do it now.")
	    RadScheduler1.InsertAppointment(apt)  
	
````
>end
