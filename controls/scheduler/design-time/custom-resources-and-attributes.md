# Custom Resources and Attributes



For each appointment, __RadScheduler__ requires the data to include an ID, subject, start time, and end time. In addition, __RadScheduler__ includes support for recurring appointments. If your data permits, you can expand on these attributes of an appointment by adding your own, custom resources and attributes. Custom resources and attributes can include details such as location, users, materials needed, and so on.

## Custom Resources

Custom resources let you associate additional information with your appointments, where the information for each field can be selected from a limited number of possibilities. That is, a custom resource acts like an enumerated type. To add a custom resource in design time:

1. Add a DataSource component to your page that can supply the list of possible values for the custom resource.

1. In the __RadScheduler__'s properties pane of the designer, click the ellipsis button on the __ResourceTypes__ property. This displays the [Resource Type Collection Editor]({%slug scheduler/design-time/resource-type-collection-editor%}).

1. In the __Resource Type Collection Editor__, define your custom resource by supplying the information __RadScheduler__ needs to bind to the list of resource type values.![Resource Type Collection Editor](images/scheduler_resourcetypecollectioneditor.png)

1. You can customize the appearance of the resource in the edit form by __EnableResourceEditing__ property of the __RadScheduler__. By default it is __"True"__.![Resource Edit Form](images/scheduler_resourceeditform.png)

>caution Be sure that your insert and update statements accept a parameter with the name of the custom resource.
>


>note The resources you define in the Resource Type Collection Editor are not used if the __RadScheduler__ gets its data from a[data provider]({%slug scheduler/data-binding/providers/using-a-data-provider%}). When using a data provider, __RadScheduler__ gets information about the available data from the provider instead.
>


Because custom resources have a limited number of values, __RadScheduler__ can group appointments based on the resources associated with them. To group appointments by a custom resource, set the __GroupBy__ property to the name of the custom resource that you specified in the Resource Type Collection Editor.

## Custom Attributes

Custom attributes are simple text values that your data source stores with the appointment. The user can enter any string of text as the value of a custom attribute. To define custom attributes

1. In the __RadScheduler__'s properties pane of the designer, click the ellipsis button on the __CustomAttributeNames__ property. This displays the string collection editor.

1. In the string collection editor, specify the names of the custom attributes you want to add. These are the names of the fields for the custom attributes in the data supplied by the Select statement of your data source. They are also the names of the parameters for the values that the scheduler passes to the Insert and Update statements of your data source.![Custom Attributes](images/scheduler_customattributes.png)

1. Set the __AdvancedForm-EnableCustomAttributeEditing__ property to __True__. This causes controls for the custom attributes to appear in the advanced edit form of the scheduler:![Custom Attribute Editor](images/scheduler_customattributeeditor.png)

>caution If you enable custom attribute editing, be sure that your insert and update statements accept a parameter with the name of the custom attribute.
>


>note Unlike Custom Resources, Custom Attributes must still be defined declaratively, even when using a data provider instead of a DataSource.
