# Responsive Adaptive and Elastic Capabilities



## Adaptive Behavior

As of Q1 2014 a new __Mobile__ rendering mode is introduced for the __RadScheduler__ control. The goal is to stay in line with the latest trends in the web development and make __RadScheduler__ UI components responsive and user friendly on mobile devices (tablets, smart phones etc.).

>caution Please note that the RadScheduler mobile rendering rely on native input elements (input type = “date|time|number”) and could not work properly on browser that does not support them.
>


In order to achieve this goal we changed the layout of most of thecomponents such as: Views, inline and advanced forms, confirmation and reminder dialogs.

The help resource for our mobile rendering mode is divided into the following help articles:

* __Views__ - Main focus on __RadScheduler__ header section and month view.

* __Interactions with appointments__ - Shows a different approach for selecting, reszing and editing an appointment.

* __Advanced form__

* __Dialogs__ - Confirmation, reminder dialogs including the inline insert/edit form.

>caution Please be aware that the RadScheduler might be not fully functional under browsers that support pointer events.
