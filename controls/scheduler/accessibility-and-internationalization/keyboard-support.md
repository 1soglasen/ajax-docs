## 

As of __Q2 2011__ RadScheduler introduces keyboars support. In order to activate it, appropriate TabIndex should be set.

The keyboard navigation has the following functionalities:

* Use the up and down arrows to move up and down the selected time slot (Day view)

* Use the up/down/right/left arrows to navigate through timeslots(Month/Week views)

* Use tab to switch the focus among appointments

* Press enter to add an appointment when the focus is on a time slot

* Press enter on existing appointment to trigger edit

* Press delete on appointment to remove it from the schedule

* Press Esc to cancel insert/update of an Appointment

* Use Shift + arrows to select multiple timeslots (like in Outlook)

The available key combinations are listed below:
