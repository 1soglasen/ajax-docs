# Compressing a Stream



Telerik **RadZipLibrary** can significantly facilitate your efforts in compress a stream, for example to send it over the internet. The library provides **CompressedStream** class that is designed to compress and decompress streams.

This article covers the following topics:

* [API Overview](#api-overview)

* [Compressing a Stream](#compressing-a-stream)

* [Decompressing a Stream](#decompressing-a-stream)

* [CompressedStream Properties](#compressedstream-properties)

## API Overview

**CompressedStream** class allows you to compress and decompress a stream. You need to initialize the class using one of the constructor overloads.

* **CompressedStream(Stream baseStream, StreamOperationMode mode, CompressionSettings settings)**

* **CompressedStream(Stream baseStream, StreamOperationMode mode,CompressionSettings settings, bool useCrc32, EncryptionSettings encryptionSettings)**

The parameters accepted by the constructors serve the following functions:

* **Stream baseStream**: A reference to a stream where the compressed result will be written when compressing data or the compressed stream that needs to be decompressed when decompressing data.

* **StreamOperationMode mode**: Specifies the operation mode of the compressed stream â€“ **Write** for compressing data and **Read** for decompressing.

* **CompressionSettings settings**: The settings used for the compression. The compression settings can be of type DeflateSettings, LzmaSettings and StoreSettings. You can read more on the topic in the [Compression Settings]({%slug ziplibrary/functionality/compression-settings%}) article.

* **bool useCrc32**: Indicates whether to use CRC32 (true) or Adler32 (false) checksum algorithm.

* **EncryptionSettings encryptionSettings**: Specifies the encryptions settings that will be used. If **null** value is passed, encryption is not performed. More information on the topic is available in the [Protect ZipArchive]({%slug ziplibrary/functionality/protect-ziparchive%}) article.

## Compressing a Stream

You can create a compressed stream by initializing new instance of the **CompressedStream** class and passing as a parameter the stream in which the compressed data will be written. You need to specify the operation mode to **Wrtie** and the compression settings that should be used.

````C#
using (CompressedStream compressedStream = new CompressedStream(outputStream, StreamOperationMode.Write, new DeflateSettings()))
{
   // write to compressed stream
}
````
````VB.NET
Using compressedStream As New CompressedStream(outputStream, StreamOperationMode.Write, New DeflateSettings())
	' write to compressed stream
End Using
````

If you want to compress a specific stream (*inputStream*), you need to copy it to the compressed stream that you've created.

````C#
using (CompressedStream compressedStream = new CompressedStream(outputStream, StreamOperationMode.Write, new DeflateSettings()))
{
   inputStream.CopyTo(compressedStream);
   compressedStream.Flush();
}
````
````VB.NET
Using compressedStream As New CompressedStream(outputStream, StreamOperationMode.Write, New DeflateSettings())
	inputStream.CopyTo(compressedStream)
	compressedStream.Flush()
End Using
````


## Decompressing a Stream

Decompressing a stream is just as simple as compressing it. All you need to do is to create new instance of **CompressedStream** class and pass it the stream from which the compressed data will be extracted, operation mode **Read**, and the compression settings that need to be used.

````C#
using (CompressedStream compressedStream = new CompressedStream(inputStream, StreamOperationMode.Read, new DeflateSettings()))
{
   compressedStream.CopyTo(outputStream);
}
````
````VB.NET
Using compressedStream As New CompressedStream(inputStream, StreamOperationMode.Read, New DeflateSettings())
	compressedStream.CopyTo(outputStream)
End Using
````


## CompressedStream Properties

The CompressedStream class derives from the Stream class and therefore it supports all its properties. However, it also exposes a set of properties that provide further information about the compressed stream.

* **BaseStream**: Property is of type [Stream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream(v=vs.110).aspx) which obtains the stream that is compressed.

* **Checksum**: Numeric value representing the checksum of the compressed stream.

* **CompressedSize**: The size of the compressed stream.

* **Length**: The uncompressed size of the stream.
