# ZipLibrary Overview



Have you ever wondered how to increase the responsiveness of your applications by compressing the data that you send over the internet? With the new **Zip Library** you can compress data like images, docx or pdf files and send them over the wire. Thus, you will achieve fast andsecure transactions.

In order to use the **Zip Library** in your application, you need to add a reference to the **Telerik.Windows.Zip.dll** assembly. This is a cross-platform library that lets you load, create and update ZIP archives on the fly with easy to use API.

The assembly will be automatically added to the Bin folder when you create a Telerik Web Forms site or you can manually find it in the AdditionalLibraries folder in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX installation (automated and manual) and in the internal builds archive. It supports .NET 4 and .NET 4.5, so depending on the target framework of your project, you need to take the assembly from the Bin40 or Bin45 folder respectively.

For a full list of the Telerik assemblies you can refer to the [Included Assemblies]({%slug introduction/installation/included-assemblies%}) article.
