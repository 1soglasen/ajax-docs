# RadMenu Items Overview



## The properties of menu items

The items of __RadMenu__ have a few important properties, which are listed below:

* __Text__ is the text of the item as it appears in the menu.

* __Value__ lets you associate a text value with the menu item that you can use when programming the menu behavior. If the item is selected, the __SelectedValue__ property of RadMenu will return the value of this property (if it is empty then the value of the __Text__ property will be returned).

* __Selected__ specifies whether the item should be selected. If set to True - the __SelectedItem__ property of RadMenu will return this item.

* __ToolTip__ is the text of a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the mouse over the item.

>note Setting the tooltip can enable an accessibility feature: Special accessibility readers like JAWS can pronounce the tooltip of the highlighted item.
>


* __Enabled__ controls whether the item is initially enabled or disabled.

* __GroupSettings__ lets you [specify how the child items are laid out]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/layout-of-child-items%}).

* __IsSeparator__ specifies whether the menu item [acts as a separator]({%slug menu/functionality/separators%}).

* __NavigateUrl__ and __Target__ cause the menu item to automatically launch another Web page (specified by __NavigateUrl__) in the window specified by __Target__. If the __Target__ property is not set, the new Web page uses the current browser window.

* __PostBack__ specifies whether the item causes a postback.

* __CssClass__, __ClickedCssClass__, __DisabledCssClass__, __ExpandedCssClas__, __SelectedCssClass__ and __FocusedCssClass__[ control the appearance of the menu item]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/setting--the-css-class-of-items%}) when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, selected and holds input focus, respectively.

* __ImageUrl__, __ImageClickedUrl__, __DisabledImageUrl__, __ExpandedImageUrl__, __SelectedImageUrl__ and __ImageOverUrl__ let you [specify an image]({%slug menu/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-items%}) that appears on the left of the menu item when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, selected and when the mouse hovers over it, respectively.

In addition to the built-in properties, you can add your own [custom attributes]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/custom-attributes%}) to menu items to expand their functionality.
