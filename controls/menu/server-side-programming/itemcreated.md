# ItemCreated



## 

__ItemCreated__ occurs every time a new item is added to __Items__ collection of the __RadMenu__ instance or to the __Items__ collection of an item in the menu. __ItemCreated__ occurs for all menu items, not just those that result from data binding (when the __DataSource__ or __DataSourceID__ property is set).If the menu is bound to a data source, this event occurs *before* any data binding: that is, before any properties have been set to reflect the data from the data source.

>note When working with data-bound menus, it can be more useful to use the __[ItemDataBound event]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemdatabound%})__ , which occurs after the item properties have been set to reflect the data source and which provides access to the __DataItem__ property of an item.
>


The __ItemCreated__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadMenu__ to which the item was just added. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadMenu__ type.

1. A __RadMenuEventArgs__ object. This object has an __Item__ property that you can use to access the item that was just added.

Use an __ItemCreated__ event handler to initialize items as they are added to the menu when it is not data bound (for example, when they are [loaded from an XML file]({%slug menu/radmenu-items/loading-items-from-xml%}) or [from a Web service]({%slug menu/data-binding/web-service-binding%})).
