# OnClientLoad



## 

The __OnClientLoad__ client-side event occurs when the __RadDropDownTree__ is first loaded and fully initialized on the client.
The event handler receives a single parameter: a reference to the client-side dropdowntree object.
You can use this event to perform your own initialization to the dropdowntree when it is loaded, or to save a reference to the dropdowntree in a global variable for reference from within your client-side code.
