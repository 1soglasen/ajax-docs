# Skins



To make customizing the appearance of __RadDropDownTree__ as easy as possible, the control uses __skins.__ A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to RadDropDown elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel.

__RadDropDownTree__ is installed with a number of built-in skins:![dropdowntree skins](images/dropdowntree_skins.png)

>note The __Hay__ , __Forest__ , __Sitefinity__ and __Transparent__ skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of __Q1 2014__ .You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
