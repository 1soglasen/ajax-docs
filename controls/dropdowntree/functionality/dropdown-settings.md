## DropDown Settings

>note These settings are available after the __Q1 2013 SP1__ release of the Telerik controls.

You can take advantage of the additional functionality that we implemented with the RadDropDownTree control by using the __DropDownSettings__:

* __AutoWidth__ - enlarges and shrinks the width of the dropdown when nodes are expanded and collapsed respectively;

* __OpenDropDownOnLoad__ - opens the dropdown when the page is loaded;

* __CloseDropDownOnSelection__ - this property is added since Q1 2014 -it closes the dropdown automatically when a new entry is selected;

* __CssClass__ - sets a custom css class that enables the used to alter the appearance of the dropdown.
