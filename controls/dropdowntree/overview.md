Some of the main features of the RadDropDownTree control include:

* Various __DataBindings__ including declarative binding, binding to __Entity DataSource__ as well as __Linq DataSource__

* __Templates__ such as __Header Template__, __Footer Template__ and __Node Template__.

* __Checkboxes__ that enable the user to choose between the different states - *None*, *SingleCheck*, *TriState* and *CheckChildNodes*.

* __EmptyMessage__ that will allow the developer to provide a hint (setting a message in the entry area) to the final user of the application.

* There are also __DropDownSettings__ that enable fine tuning of the control (*OpenDropDownOnLoad* that expands the dropdown after it is loaded on the page is one of them).
