## Main features of the RadDropDownTree

Some of the main features of the RadDropDownTree control include:

* Various **DataBindings** including declarative binding, binding to **Entity DataSource** as well as **Linq DataSource**

* **Templates** such as **Header Template**, **Footer Template** and **Node Template**.

* **Checkboxes** that enable the user to choose between the different states - *None*, *SingleCheck*, *TriState* and *CheckChildNodes*.

* **EmptyMessage** that will allow the developer to provide a hint (setting a message in the entry area) to the final user of the application.

* There are also **DropDownSettings** that enable fine tuning of the control (*OpenDropDownOnLoad* that expands the dropdown after it is loaded on the page is one of them).
