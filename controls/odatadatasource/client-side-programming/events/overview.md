# Events Overview



## 

RadODataDataSource supports several client-side events that let you customize the processing of data:

* __[OnRequesting]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequesting%})__ - occurs when data is requested form the web service;

* __[OnRequestSucceeded]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequestsucceeded%})__ - occurs when the request is executed successfully;

* __[OnRequestFail]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequestfail%})__ - occurs in case the request fails.
