# Series Configuration



This help article lists all the inner tags and properties of the RadHtmlChart Series collections and illustrates how to configure them.

__RadHtmlChart__ provides a rich set of properties which can help you configure the look and behavior of the defined RadHtmlChart Series. In this article you will find a list with the available Series inner tags and public properties.

You can add the series to the Main tag > PlotArea > Series tag. The series have many common properties and some specific properties according to the series type. To create Series Items programmatically, you must use the respective class for each series type.

* __AreaSeries__, __BarSeries__, __ColumnSeries__, __LineSeries__, __RadarAreaSeries__, __RadarColumnSeries__ and __RadarLineSeries__ use the __CategorySeriesItem__ class.

* __BoxPlotSeries__ use the __BoxPlotSeriesItem__ class.

* __BubbleSeries__ use the __BubbleSeriesItem__ class.

* __CandlestickSeries__ use the __CandlestickSeriesItem__ class.

* __DonutSeries__ and __PieSeries__ use the __PieSeriesItem__ class.

* __FunnelSeries__ use the __FunnelSeriesItem__ class.

* __PolarAreaSeries__, __PolarLineSeries__ and __PolarScatterSeries__ use the __PolarSeriesItem__ class.

* __RangeBarSeries__ and __RangeColumnSeries__ use the __RangeSeriesItem__ class.

* __ScatterSeries__ and __ScatterLineSeries__ use the __ScatterSeriesItem__ class.

* __WaterfallSeries__ and __HorizontalWaterfallSeries__ use the __WaterfallSeriesItem__ class.

In order to access the properties of the series in the code-behind, you must cast the series to the respective series type (e.g., (RadHtmlChart1.PlotArea.Series[0] as ColumnSeries).SeriesItems[0].Y = 10;).

More information on the series properties is available below.
