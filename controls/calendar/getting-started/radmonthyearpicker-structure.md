## 

The __RadMonthYearPicker__ control is composite control that combines the functionality of __RadCalendar__ with the functionality of__RadDateInput__ to give the broadest possible range of options for selectingmonth and year values. The control elements are described below:![RadMonthYearPicker Structure](images/calendar_monthyearpicker_overview.png)

The three major components of a __RadMonthYearPicker__ control are:

* __Input area__ - This is an embedded __RadDateInput__ control, which validates dates or times as the user types.

* __Popup control__ - This is a __MonthYearPickerTableView__ that is shown in a popup element, so that the user can select a month or year by clicking on the desired selection.

* __Date Popup Button__ - an image button, displayed next to the input area that shows and hides the popup control.
