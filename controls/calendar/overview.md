# RadCalendar Overview


The Telerik **RadCalendar** controls are a set of highly configurable components for selecting date and time values. These controls are:

* **RadCalendar**: A highly configurable control for displaying and selecting date values from an interface laid out like a standard calendar.

* **RadDatePicker**: A **RadDateInput** control with an integrated **RadCalendar** control to let users either enter the date and time value directly into the input area or select it from a calendar popup. The values of the two controls are synchronized to allow further change of the chosen date.

* **RadTimePicker**: A **RadDateInput** control in time only mode with integrated **RadTimeView** control to let users enter a time directly in the input area or select it from the time view control popup. The values of the two controls are synchronized to allow further change of the chosen time.

* **RadDateTimePicker**: A **RadDateInput** control with integrated **RadCalendar** and **RadTimeView** controls. **RadDateTimePicker** combines the features of **RadDatePicker** and **RadTimePicker** in a single control for selecting both a date and a time value.
