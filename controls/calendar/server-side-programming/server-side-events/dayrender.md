# DayRender



## 

The __RadCalendar__ control provides the __DayRender__ server event, which is raised after all the cells of the day matrix have been generated and just before a cell is rendered to the client. It is the last place where changes to the already constructed calendar cells can be made.

The __DayRender__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadCalendar__ control whose cell is about to be rendered. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadCalendar__ type.

1. A __DayRenderEventArgs__ object. This object carries the following three arguments:

* __Cell__ is the control for the cell that is about to be rendered. The event handler can make changes to this control to change the way the cell is rendered.

* __Day__ is the __RadCalendarDay__ object that represents the day that the cell represents. Use this object to obtain information about the date the cell represents, and about its state (IsDisabled, IsToday, IsSelected, and so on).

* __View__ is the __MonthView__ object that represents the month in which the cell occurs. Use this to obtain information about the context in which the cell occurs.

Use the __DayRender__ event handler to make changes to the cell before it is rendered. For example, the following event handler changes the text of dates in the non-current month, and changes the appearance of today's date:



````C#
	
	    protected void RadCalendar1_DayRender(object sender, Telerik.Web.UI.Calendar.DayRenderEventArgs e)
	    {
	        DateTime CurrentDate = e.Day.Date;
	        if (CurrentDate.Month != RadCalendar1.FocusedDate.Month)
	        {
	            e.Cell.Text = "(" + CurrentDate.Day + ")";
	        }
	        else if (e.Day.IsToday)
	        {
	            e.Cell.Style["background-color"] = "Red";
	        }
	    }
````
````VB.NET
	     
	    Protected Sub RadCalendar1_DayRender(ByVal sender As Object, _
	    ByVal e As Telerik.Web.UI.Calendar.DayRenderEventArgs) _
	    Handles RadCalendar1.DayRender
	        Dim CurrentDate As DateTime = e.Day.[Date]
	        If CurrentDate.Month <> RadCalendar1.FocusedDate.Month Then
	            e.Cell.Text = "(" + CurrentDate.Day + ")"
	        ElseIf e.Day.IsToday Then
	            e.Cell.Style("background-color") = "Red"
	        End If
	    End Sub

>note When customizing the appearance of the cells of the calendar using the __DayRender__ event, it is often helpful to also create a handler for the client-side[OnDayRender]({%slug calendar/client-side-programming/events/ondayrender%})event that makes the same customizations when the user changes the view.
