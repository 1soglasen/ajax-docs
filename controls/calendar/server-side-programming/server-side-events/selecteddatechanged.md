# SelectedDateChanged



## 

__RadDatePicker__, __RadTimePicker__, __RadDateTimePicker__ and __RadMonthYearPicker__ provide the __SelectedDateChanged__server event, which occurs when theuser changes the value of the control, either when input area loses focus after the user has typed a new value, or when the user selects a new value in the popup calendar or time viewcontrol. This event does not fire unless the __AutoPostBack__ property is__True__ (__RadDatePicker__, __RadTimePicker__ and __RadMonthYearPicker__) or the __AutoPostBackControl__ property is not"None" (__RadDateTimePicker__).

>note The event handler is not called unless the date and/or time actually changes. If the user makes a change that results in the same value (for example, typing a different string thatparses to the same value), a postback occurs but the __SelectedDateChanged__ event handler is not called.
>


The __SelectedDateChanged__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The control whose value has just changed. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the appropriate type.

1. A __SelectedDateChangedEventArgs__ object. This object has the following two properties:

* __OldDate__ is the value before the change.

* __NewDate__is the value after the change.

You can use this event to respond in server-side code when the user changes the value:
