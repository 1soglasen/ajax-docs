# ChildrenCreated



## 

__RadDatePicker__, __RadTimePicker__,__RadDateTimePicker__ and __RadMonthYearPicker__ expose the __ChildrenCreated__ server event, which occurs after the child controls are created.

>caution  __ChildrenCreated__ can be wired only during the __Page_PreInit__ event, since it is fired before the regular handlers are attached.
>


The__ChildrenCreated__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The control whose children have just been created. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the appropriate type.

1. A __DefaultViewChangedEventArgs__ object. This object has the following two properties:

* __OldView__ is the CalendarView object for the view that was current before the change.

* __NewView__ is the CalendarView object for the current view after the change.

You can use this event to set date input, calendar and time view properties, or add additional controls. The following example uses the __ChildrenCreated__ event handler to add a control that clears the selection:



````C#
	
	
	    protected void RadDatepicker1_ChildrenCreated(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
	    {
	        RadDatePicker picker = (RadDatePicker)sender;
	        HyperLink clearLink = new HyperLink();
	        clearLink.NavigateUrl = string.Format("javascript:$find('{0}').Clear()", picker.ClientID);
	        clearLink.Text = "Clear";
	        picker.Controls.Add(clearLink);
	    }
				
````
````VB.NET
	     
	
	    Protected Sub RadDatePicker1_ChildrenCreated(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles RadDatePicker1.ChildrenCreated
	        Dim picker As RadDatePicker = DirectCast(sender, RadDatePicker)
	        Dim clearLink As New HyperLink()
	        clearLink.NavigateUrl = _
	          String.Format("javascript:$find('{0}').Clear()", picker.ClientID)
	        clearLink.Text = "Clear"
	        picker.Controls.Add(clearLink)
	    End Sub
