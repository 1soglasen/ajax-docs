# Server-Side Objects



The **RadCalendar** controls provide a rich API with classes that expose several properties, enumerations, methods and events. You can use the API to easily customize the controls programmatically in the code-behind.

This class is used for the **Day** property of the event arguments of the [DayRender]({%slug calendar/server-side-programming/server-side-events/dayrender%}) event, as well as for the elements in the [SpecialDays]({%slug calendar/design-time/radcalendarday-collection-editor%}) collection.
