# OnClientTimeSelecting



## 

It is sometimes necessary for a **TimeView** selection to be canceled. This may be the case when we have disabled a particular **TimeView** cell. An example of this is when the user should be able to select given time intervals, but not other.

>note The **OnClientTimeSelecting** event is supported by: **RadTimeView** .
>


The event handler receives two arguments:

1. the [RadTimeView]({%slug calendar/client-side-programming/radtimeview-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. an event arguments object that exposes the following methods:OnClientTimeSelecting event arguments object


| Name | Return Type | Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **get_oldTime()** |Date object||Returns the time before the user selected a new time value.|
| **get_newTime()** |Date object||Returns the newly selected time value.|
| **set_cancel(value)** ||bool|Lets you prevent the selection or deselection from occurring.|

In this case, one can use the OnClientTimeSelecting client side event handler, which is cancelable. One usage is demonstrated by the code sample below:

````ASPNET
<telerik:RadTimePicker runat="server" Id="Picker1">
    <TimeView runat="server" ID="TimeView1" OnClientTimeSelecting="clientTimeSelecting">
    </TimeView>
</telerik:RadTimePicker>
````
````JavaScript
function clientTimeSelecting(sender, eventArgs) {
    eventArgs.set_cancel(true);
}	
````
