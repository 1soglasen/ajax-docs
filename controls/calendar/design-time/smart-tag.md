# Smart Tag



The __Smart Tag__ allows easy access to frequently needed tasks. You can display it by right clicking on a control in the design window, and choosing __Show Smart Tag__ from its context menu.

## RadCalendar Smart Tag

The __RadCalendar__ Smart Tag lets you perform the following:

## RadCalendar Tasks

* __SelectedDate__ - lets you initialize the value of the __RadDatePicker__control to a date you select from a popup calendar.

* __MinDate__ and __MaxDate__ - specify the range of valid dates that the usercan enter into the RadDatePicker control.

* __Enable Keyboard Navigation__ - toggles support for Access Keys and navigation using the tab keys or arrow keys.

* __Enable Month-Year Fast Navigation__ - enables or disables the month/year popup which appears when the user clicksthe title area of the title bar. It allows the user to change the current view by selecting a specific month and year, or to move to the view that contains the current date.

* __Enable AutoPostBack__ - lets you enable or disable postbacks when the user selects a date using the calendar control or changes the view using the navigation controls in the title bar. By default, the calendar does not do a postback when the user makes these changes.

* __Enable MultiSelect__ - lets you specify whether the calendar can be used to select multiple dates or only a single date.

* __Highlight Today's date__ - applies a special css class to highlight the cell which holds the present day.

* __Edit Special Days__ - brings up the [RadCalendarDay Collection Editor]({%slug calendar/design-time/radcalendarday-collection-editor%}), where you can create a collection of "special" days that look and behave differently than other days in the calendar.

## Ajax Resources

* __Add RadAjaxManager__ - adds a RadAjaxManager component to your Web page, and displays the __RadAjax Property Builder__ where you can configure it.

* __Replace ScriptManager with RadScriptManager__ - replaces the default __ScriptManager__ component that is added for AJAX-enabled Web sites with __RadScriptManager__.

* __Add RadStyleSheetManager__ - adds a __RadStyleSheetManager__ to your Web page.

## Skin

The __Skin__ drop-down lets you select from a list of available [skins]({%slug calendar/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look of your __RadCalendar__ control.

## Learning Center

Links navigate you directly to __RadCalendar__ examples, help, or Code Library. You can also search the Telerik web site for a given string.

## Edit Templates

The __Edit Templates__ link brings up the [Template Design Surface]({%slug calendar/design-time/template-design-surface%}), where you can design templates for the calendar header and footer sections.![Showing the RadCalendar Smart Tag](images/calendar_gettingstarted_001.png)
