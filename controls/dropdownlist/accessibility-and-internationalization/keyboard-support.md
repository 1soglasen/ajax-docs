# Keyboard Support



## 

**RadDropDownList** provides support for the two relevant aspects of keyboard support:

* **Access Keys** - You can specify a key that lets the end-user move focus directly to the dropdownlist. Once focus is on the dropdownlist, the user can use the arrow keys for navigation. The access key is defined using the **AccessKey** property. For example, if you set the **AccessKey** property to "W", focus moves to the combobox when the user types "Alt+W".

* **Key Navigation**-RadDropDownList allows end-users to navigate the dropdownlist structure using the arrow keys, the PageUp/PageDown keys and the Enter key:

* The "Alt + W" focuses the drop-down list. ![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-focus](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-focus.png)

* The "Alt + Up" arrow opens the drop-down list. ![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-open](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-open.png)

* The "PageUp" or "PageDown" arrows to scroll to the previous/next “page” in the drop down listof items.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-navigationpage](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-navigationpage.png)

* The "Esc" key to close the list without changing the selection.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-close](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-close.png)

* The up and down arrow keys allows user to navigate along the items in the drop down list in the corresponding direction.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-navigation](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-navigation.png)

* The "Enter" key selects the current item in the list.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-select](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-select.png)

* Typing a letter moves focus to the next instance of a visible item, whose text begins with that letter.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-highlightnextelement](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-highlightnextelement.png)

* Typing a sequence of letters moves focus to the first matched item, whose text starts with that sequence.![dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-highlightmatchingelement](images/dropdownlist-accessibilityandinternalization-keyboardsupport-highlightmatchingelement.png)
