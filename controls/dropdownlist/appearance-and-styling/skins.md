# Skins



To make customizing the appearance of **RadDropDownList** as easy as possible, the control uses **skins.** A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to RadDropDown elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel.

**RadDropDownList** is installed with a number of built-in skins:![dropdownlist skins](images/dropdownlist_skins.png)

>note The **Hay** , **Forest** , **Sitefinity** and **Transparent** skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of **Q1 2014** .You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
