# Rating Overview





__Telerik RadRating__is a flexible UI component that allows users to intuitively rate by selecting number of items [stars] from a predefined maximum number of items. The user can fully customize the control by configuring its orientation, rating precision, direction etc.



## Key features:

* __Horizontal/Vertical Orientation__ - depending on your needs, RadRating can be displayed horizontally or vertically on the page by setting the __Orientation__ property.

* __Direction__ - you can configure the RadRating to reverse its standard direction using its __IsDirectionReversed__ property. The standard direction is from left to right (or from top to bottom if it has vertical orientation).

* __Maximum Number of Items__ - by setting a value to the __ItemCount__ property you can easily choose the maximum number of items the user can rate from.

* __Selection Mode__ - it can be Single or Continuous. In Single mode a single item [star] is marked as selected and in Continuous mode all items, starting from the first one, are marked as selected.

* __Rating Precision__- the RadRating control enables the users to select their rating value precisely. By setting the __Precision__ property to one of the following: Exact, Half, Item - you can rate by selecting: a precise part of the star [Exact], half a star [Half] or the whole star [Item].
