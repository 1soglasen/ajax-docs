# Multi-Language Support for RadChart



>caution  **RadChart** has been replaced by[RadHtmlChart](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's client-side charting component.	If you are considering **RadChart** for new development, examine the[RadHtmlChart documentation](ffd58685-7423-4c50-9554-f92c70a75138)and[online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)first to see if it will fit your development needs.	If you are already using **RadChart** in your projects, you can migrate to **RadHtmlChart** by following these articles:[Migrating Series](2f393f28-bc31-459c-92aa-c3599785f6cc),[Migrating Axes](3f1bea81-87b9-4324-b0d2-d13131031048),[Migrating Date Axes](93226130-bc3c-4c53-862a-f9e17b2eb7dd),[Migrating Databinding](d6c5e2f1-280c-4fb0-b5b0-2f507697511d),[Feature parity](010dc716-ce38-480b-9157-572e0f140169).	Support for **RadChart** is discontinued as of **Q3 2014** , but the control will remain in the assembly so it can still be used.	We encourage you to use **RadHtmlChart** for new development.

RadChart bridges off the rich localization feature set already built into ASP.NET 2.0. See the following resources for background information and tools for ASP.NET 2.0 localization:

* [ASP.NET QuickStart Tutorials](http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/localization/localization.aspx)

* [Google Language Tools](http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en) for translating (used in prototyping, not production).

See the following localization tutorials:

* [Local, Implicit localization example.]({%slug chart/advanced-topics/localization-example-using-local-resources,-implicit-expression%})

* [Global, Explicit localization example.]({%slug chart/advanced-topics/localization-example-using-global-resources,-explicit-expression%})

The resources used for localization can be **local** or **global**:

**Local**resources are used for the controls on a specific page. This method assumes the existence of a resource file located in the ASP.NET Folder **App_LocalResources** with the same name as the page you're translating. So, if you're localizing default.aspx, ASP.NET expects to see default.aspx.resx (the default language), and translated versions e.g. default.aspx.fr-FR.resx for a French translation.

Resources can also be **global**, i.e. shared anywhere in the application. This method uses a resource file located in the ASP.NET folder **App_GlobalResource**.

There are two syntaxes used in specifying items on the page that need translation, **Explicit** and **Implicit:**

* **Explicit**uses expression binding syntax like that used for binding data in-line to the ASP.NET HTML page. This type of expression can be used to identify both local and global resources. In the example below the chart title Text property is being explicitly set to a resource item named "Title" in the resource file \App_GlobalResource\MyGlobals.resx.

````ASPNET
	    <charttitle>
	       <TextBlock Text="<$ Resources>"></TextBlock>
	    </charttitle>
````



* **Implicit**assumes the existence of a resource file located in the ASP.NET Folder App_LocalResources with the same name as the page you're translating. Notice in the example below the meta:resourcekey attribute.The resource key in the HTML ties back to the name of the resource item in the resource file. Using the resource key and the property value in the resource file you can define any number of properties.In the example below the chart title text name in the resource file is formatted as <resourcekey><property name>, i.e. "RadChart1Resource1.ChartTitle.TextBlock.Text".

````ASPNET
	    
	    <telerik:RadChart ID="RadChart1" runat="server" enableembeddedskins="False"
	   meta:resourcekey="RadChart1Resource1">
	   <PlotArea>
	       <YAxis MaxValue="50">
	       </YAxis>
	       <YAxis2 MaxValue="3" MinValue="1" Step="1">
	       </YAxis2>
	       <XAxis MaxValue="3" MinValue="1" Step="1">
	       </XAxis>
	   </PlotArea>
	   <ChartTitle>
	       <TextBlock Text="Sales">
	       </TextBlock>
	   </ChartTitle>
	   ...
