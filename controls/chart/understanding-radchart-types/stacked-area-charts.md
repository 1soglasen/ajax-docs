>caution  **RadChart** has been replaced by[RadHtmlChart](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's client-side charting component.	If you are considering **RadChart** for new development, examine the[RadHtmlChart documentation](ffd58685-7423-4c50-9554-f92c70a75138)and[online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)first to see if it will fit your development needs.	If you are already using **RadChart** in your projects, you can migrate to **RadHtmlChart** by following these articles:[Migrating Series](2f393f28-bc31-459c-92aa-c3599785f6cc),[Migrating Axes](3f1bea81-87b9-4324-b0d2-d13131031048),[Migrating Date Axes](93226130-bc3c-4c53-862a-f9e17b2eb7dd),[Migrating Databinding](d6c5e2f1-280c-4fb0-b5b0-2f507697511d),[Feature parity](010dc716-ce38-480b-9157-572e0f140169).	Support for **RadChart** is discontinued as of **Q3 2014** , but the control will remain in the assembly so it can still be used.	We encourage you to use **RadHtmlChart** for new development.

The Stacked Area chart is a variation of the Area chart that display trends of the contribution of each value over time (or across categories). The areas are stacked so that each series adjoins but does not overlap the preceding series. This contrasts with the Area chart where each series overlays the preceding series.

Depending on the Skin used, RadChart can automatically differentiate each series by displaying it in a different color. The appearance for each series can also be modified directly.

To create a Vertical Stacked Area Chart set the SeriesOrientation property to **Vertical**. Set the RadChart DefaultType property or ChartSeries.Type to **StackedArea**.
