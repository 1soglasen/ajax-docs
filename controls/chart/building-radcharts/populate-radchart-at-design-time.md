# Populate RadChart at Design-Time



>caution  __RadChart__ has been replaced by[RadHtmlChart](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's client-side charting component.	If you are considering __RadChart__ for new development, examine the[RadHtmlChart documentation](ffd58685-7423-4c50-9554-f92c70a75138)and[online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)first to see if it will fit your development needs.	If you are already using __RadChart__ in your projects, you can migrate to __RadHtmlChart__ by following these articles:[Migrating Series](2f393f28-bc31-459c-92aa-c3599785f6cc),[Migrating Axes](3f1bea81-87b9-4324-b0d2-d13131031048),[Migrating Date Axes](93226130-bc3c-4c53-862a-f9e17b2eb7dd),[Migrating Databinding](d6c5e2f1-280c-4fb0-b5b0-2f507697511d),[Feature parity](010dc716-ce38-480b-9157-572e0f140169).	Support for __RadChart__ is discontinued as of __Q3 2014__ , but the control will remain in the assembly so it can still be used.	We encourage you to use __RadHtmlChart__ for new development.

RadChart provides two collection editors: ChartSeries Collection Editor and ChartSeriesItem Collection Editor.____They allow you to easily create series and items, and set the relevant properties without writing any code. 

There are two basic steps to populate the RadChart with data:

1. Click on the RadChart Series property ellipses to display the ChartSeries Collection Editor. Here you can add or remove series in the Members list box on the left side of the editor. You can set the series level properties by selecting a series member and editing properties in the properties window located on the right hand side of the editor. See topics [Series Overview]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-elements/series-overview%}), [Series Items]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-elements/series-items%}) and [Series-Specific Properties]({%slug chart/understanding-radchart-elements/series-specific-properties%}) for more information. Note the Items property under the Series property category.
