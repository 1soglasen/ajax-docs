>caution  __RadChart__ has been replaced by[RadHtmlChart](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's client-side charting component.	If you are considering __RadChart__ for new development, examine the[RadHtmlChart documentation](ffd58685-7423-4c50-9554-f92c70a75138)and[online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)first to see if it will fit your development needs.	If you are already using __RadChart__ in your projects, you can migrate to __RadHtmlChart__ by following these articles:[Migrating Series](2f393f28-bc31-459c-92aa-c3599785f6cc),[Migrating Axes](3f1bea81-87b9-4324-b0d2-d13131031048),[Migrating Date Axes](93226130-bc3c-4c53-862a-f9e17b2eb7dd),[Migrating Databinding](d6c5e2f1-280c-4fb0-b5b0-2f507697511d),[Feature parity](010dc716-ce38-480b-9157-572e0f140169).	Support for __RadChart__ is discontinued as of __Q3 2014__ , but the control will remain in the assembly so it can still be used.	We encourage you to use __RadHtmlChart__ for new development.

## Compliance Level

Telerik RadChart now provides complete XHTML compliance.

The generated HTML output is fully XHTML 1.1 with the following exception:

Browsers don't fully support XHTML 1.1 compliant image maps, so when using charts with image maps the generated HTML is only XHTML 1.0 compliant.

## XHTML

XHTML stands for E__X__tensible __H__yper__T__ext __M__arkup __L__anguage: a stricter and cleaner version of HTML recommended by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium). XHTML is the effective inheritor of HTML 4.01 and although it is almost identical to its predecessor it is aimed at replacing it.
