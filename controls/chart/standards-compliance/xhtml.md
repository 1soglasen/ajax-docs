If you are considering **RadChart** for new development, examine the[RadHtmlChart documentation](ffd58685-7423-4c50-9554-f92c70a75138)and[online demos](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx)first to see if it will fit your development needs.	If you are already using **RadChart** in your projects, you can migrate to **RadHtmlChart** by following these articles:[Migrating Series](2f393f28-bc31-459c-92aa-c3599785f6cc),[Migrating Axes](3f1bea81-87b9-4324-b0d2-d13131031048),[Migrating Date Axes](93226130-bc3c-4c53-862a-f9e17b2eb7dd),[Migrating Databinding](d6c5e2f1-280c-4fb0-b5b0-2f507697511d),[Feature parity](010dc716-ce38-480b-9157-572e0f140169).

## Compliance Level

Telerik RadChart now provides complete XHTML compliance.

The generated HTML output is fully XHTML 1.1 with the following exception:

Browsers don't fully support XHTML 1.1 compliant image maps, so when using charts with image maps the generated HTML is only XHTML 1.0 compliant.

## XHTML

XHTML stands for E**X**tensible **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage: a stricter and cleaner version of HTML recommended by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium). XHTML is the effective inheritor of HTML 4.01 and although it is almost identical to its predecessor it is aimed at replacing it.
