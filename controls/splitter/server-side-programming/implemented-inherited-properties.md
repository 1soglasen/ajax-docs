# Implemented Inherited Properties



Similarly to all Telerik controls, the __RadSplitter__ class inherits the[WebControl](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1x24e42)	and/or the [Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/983zwx2h)	one. Since not all of the inherited properties are implemented in __RadSplitter__ and its children, above you can see a list with these ones, which configuring will affect the controls.
