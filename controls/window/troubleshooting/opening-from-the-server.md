# Opening from the Server



## 

The __RadWindow__ is a client-side object – its UI is created when it is first shown and this is the point when the CSS and scripts are loaded as well. This means that it should be used on the client via JavaScript, yet it turns out that it is a very common scenario that the developer wishes to initiate the __RadWindow__’s showing from the code-behind.

>warning The __VisibleOnPageLoad__ property should __ *not* __ be used for this purpose. It is a behavior property which will result in the RadWindow opening every time the page is post back.
>


Quite often the __VisibleOnPageLoad__ property gets set to __true__ while the intention is that the RadWindow should only show once. Doing so will result in the RadWindow reopening if a postback is initiated from another element from the page, which is rarely the desired behavior. Also, this approach will not work in case this happens in an AJAX request and the RadWindow is not included in the partial page update.

There are several ways to work around this:

* [Register a JavaScript function from the server-side]({%slug window/troubleshooting/executing-javascript-code-from-server%}) and do __not__ use the __VisibleOnPageLoad__ property, for example:

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadWindow runat="server" ID="RadWindow1" NavigateUrl="http://google.com/"></telerik:RadWindow>
	    <asp:Button ID="Button4" Text="open the RadWindow from the server" runat="server" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
````





````C#
	        protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
	        {
	            //business logic goes here
	
	            string script = "function f(){$find(\"" + RadWindow1.ClientID + "\").show(); Sys.Application.remove_load(f);}Sys.Application.add_load(f);";
	            ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(Page, Page.GetType(), "key", script, true);
	        }
````
````VB.NET
	        Protected Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
	            'business logic goes here
	
	            Dim script As String = "function f(){$find(""" + RadWindow1.ClientID + """).show(); Sys.Application.remove_load(f);}Sys.Application.add_load(f);"
				ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(Page, Page.GetType(), "key", script, True)
	        End Sub
	    #End Region
	End Class




* Reset the __VisibleOnPageLoad__ property to __false__ with code when suitable, depending on the particular scenario

* Set __EnableViewState__ to __false__ for the RadWindowManager that contains the desired RadWindows
