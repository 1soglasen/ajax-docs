# Alert, Confirm, Prompt Dialogs Overview



## 

You can replace the standard alert, confirm, and prompt dialog boxes that are provided by the browser when you call the __window.alert__, __window.prompt__ and __window.confirm__ commands. The replacement dialog boxes are called with the __radalert__, __radprompt__ and __radconfirm__ methods, correspondingly. The replacement popups are implemented using __RadWindow__, and are a good deal more flexible than their browser counterparts. This means that you can use the [RadWindow's client-side API]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) with them, because the JavaScript functions that are used to call them return a reference to the RadWindow object. You can modify the look and feel of most aspects of these dialogs and it's easier to get information to and from them.

A __RadWindowManager__ must be present on the form for you to use the __radalert__, __radconfirm__, and __radprompt__ dialogs. The __RadWindow__ objects that implement the dialogs get the setting for their __Skin__ property from the __RadWindowManager__, resulting in a dialog that blends into the design of your Web site more completely than the corresponding browser dialogs.

Unlike browser popups, which can only display text, you can pass HTML to the RadWindow popups for a richer user experience and improved usability.

>caution The Telerik RadWindow popups are non-blocking; that is, they do not block the execution thread on the server. This is because the execution of the thread cannot be blocked by JavaScript. This non-blocking feature has some important implications:
>
* The Telerik RadWindow popups are modal. That is, they block the content underneath and prevent the user from interacting with it. However, because of the non-blocking nature of the popups, there are ways to work around this modal behavior. If it is absolutely necessary that a popup is modal then the default browser popups should be used.
* If the non-blocking nature of the __radconfirm__ dialog is a problem, there is a possible workaround described in the followingOnline Demo:[Confirm Server Clicks](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/window/examples/confirmserverclicks/defaultcs.aspx). The general approach is to move the functionality that requires the user's input to the callback function. It has some limitations and peculiarities which are listed in the demo description (e.g. that you must be able to finish the task via JavaScript only). The following Code Library article provides a different approach that overrides the entire function:[Block the execution thread with radconfirm](http://www.telerik.com/community/code-library/aspnet-ajax/window/block-the-execution-thread-with-radconfirm.aspx). Be aware that the approach described there works only for elements that have a click method and there is no guarantee that it will work in all scenarios. As an alternative, you could use __doPostback() in the ClientCallback function or ajaxRequestWithTarget() if you are using RadAjaxManager ([using ajaxRequestWithTarget() with radconfirm](http://www.telerik.com/community/code-library/aspnet-ajax/window/block-the-execution-thread-with-radconfirm.aspx#1242035))>


Since Q1 2011 the __RadWindowManager__ offers built-in [server-side methods]({%slug window/server-side-programming/methods%}) to call the __RadAlert, RadConfirm and RadPrompt__ dialogs.

Since Q1 2012 the RadAlert and RadConfirm offer the option to accept an URL for an image that will be displayed on the left instead of their default icon for both the server-side and client-side methods.
