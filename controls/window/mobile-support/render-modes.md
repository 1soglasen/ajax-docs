# Render Modes



__RadWindow and RadWindowManager__ have two different render modes that can change the actual HTML markup that is rendered.	They are exposed via the __RenderMode__ property that can have four	possible values - __Classic__, __Lightweight__, __Mobile__ and __Auto__.	This functionality was introduced in the __Q2 2013__ version.

The possible options are:

* __Classic__—this mode is the rendering that has been used before. It remains without changes and it is the default value of the property.	In this mode tables and background images (in several sprites) are used to create	the layout (including rounded corners and shadows).

* __Lightweight__—this mode emphasizes on semantic HTML and CSS3. It reduces the amount of markup the control renders	(even though this happens with JavaScript) and makes it easier to customize. This also reduces the number of image sprites the control uses to a single one for the command buttons.	All of this decreases the overall size and complexity of each skin, including custom ones.

* __Mobile__—this mode is currently not supported. If you set it, the mode will fall back automatically to __Lightweight__.

* __Auto__—this mode makes each control choose the appropriate rendering mode according to the used	browser - __Classic__ or __Lightweight__. This functionality was added in Q3 2013.

>important RadWindow and RadWindowManager, as well as the other controls included in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite that utilize render modes, support only one type of render mode per page.	This includes mode being set for a standalone RadWindow and RadWindowManager. All such controls must have the same RenderMode on a given page.	This also includes instances from user controls and master pages.

>note A RadWindow that is inside the Windows collection of a RadWindowManager will inherit the manager's render mode.

## Setting Render Mode

There are two ways to configure the rendering mode of the controls:

* The __RenderMode property__ in the markup or in the code-behind that can be used for a particular instance:

````ASPNET
			<telerik:RadWindow ID="RadWindow1" runat="server" RenderMode="Lightweight">
			</telerik:RadWindow>
			<telerik:RadWindowManager ID="RadWindowManager1" runat="server" RenderMode="Lightweight">
			</telerik:RadWindowManager>
````



>tabbedCode

````C#
			RadWindow1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight;
			RadWindowManager1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight;
````
````VB.NET
			RadWindow1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight
			RadWindowManager1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight
	#End Region
	
	End Class


>end

* A __global setting in the web.config__ file that will affect the entire application, unless a concrete value is specifiedfor a given control instance:

````XML
		<appSettings>
			<add key="Telerik.Web.UI.Window.RenderMode" value="lightweight" />
		</appSettings>
````
