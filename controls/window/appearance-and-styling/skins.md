# Skins



## 

Skins control the overall look and feel of a __RadWindow__ object. By using Skins consistently, you can make your windows fit in with the design of the rest of a Web site, increasing usability and attractiveness. If you use the RadWindow versions of the Alert, Prompt, and Confirm dialogs, you can use the same skin with these dialogs and have them blend in more harmoniously with your Web site than the built-in browser dialogs do.

Specify the Skin to use by setting the __Skin__ property of the __RadWindowManager__ object. All windows that the __RadWindowManager__ controls then inherit that Skin, including the Alert, Prompt, and Confirm dialogs. You can override this default Skin by setting the __Skin__ property on an individual __RadWindow__ object.

There is a number of built-in skins for the RadWindow control:
