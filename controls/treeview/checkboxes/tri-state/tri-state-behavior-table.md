# Tri-State-Behavior Table



## 

Due to the specifics behind the Tri-State functionality the behavior of RadTreeView can be different in some cases. Below is a table describing these differences:


>caption Â 

|  __Use Case\Properties__  |  __Behavior__  |
| ------ | ------ |
|Clicking on a Node's CheckBox|Clicking on a Node's CheckBox updates the states of its child Nodes' CheckBoxes (if they exist) to match its own: __Checked__ or __Unchecked__ .|
|Load-On-Demand|Added child Nodes update __*__ the state of their Parent according to their CheckBox states to one of the Tri-States: __Checked__ , __Indeterminate or Unchecked__ .|
|Adding Nodes at the server|Added child Nodes update __*__ the state of their Parent according to their CheckBox states to one of the Tri-States: __Checked__ , __Indeterminate or Unchecked__ .|
|Adding Nodes in Design-Time|Updating the state of a Node's CheckBox updates the states of its child Nodes' CheckBoxes (if they exist) to match its own: __Checked__ or __Unchecked__ .|
|Checking/Unchecking Nodes in HTML|The state of a parent Node's CheckBox is always determined by the states of its child Nodes' CheckBoxes (regardless of the value of its __Checked__ property).|



>tip  __*__ To override this behavior, that is to determine the state of the child Node's CheckBoxes based on the state of their parent Node's CheckBox, please see the[Inherit the the Checked state of the parent Node when loading Nodes on demand]({%slug treeview/application-scenarios/checkboxes/inherit-the-the-checked-state-of-the-parent-node-in-load-on-demand%})topic.
