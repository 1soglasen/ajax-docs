# Single Expand Path



## 

The RadTreeView **SingleExpandPath** property, when set to **True**, automatically collapses Nodes that are not on the path of the currently expanded Node. Use the **SingleExpandPath**property when you need to conserve screen space and make navigating Nodes easier.
