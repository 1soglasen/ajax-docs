# Single Expand Path



## 

The RadTreeView __SingleExpandPath__ property, when set to __True__, automatically collapses Nodes that are not on the path of the currently expanded Node. Use the __SingleExpandPath__property when you need to conserve screen space and make navigating Nodes easier.
