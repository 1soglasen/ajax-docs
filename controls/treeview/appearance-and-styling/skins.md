# Skins



## 

To make customizing the appearance of RadTreeView as easy as possible, the control uses **skins.** A skin is a set of images and a CSS style sheet that can be applied to the TreeView elements (Nodes, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the TreeView, set its **Skin** property, either using the properties pane or the RadTreeView [Smart Tag]({%slug treeview/design-time/smart-tag%}).

RadTreeView comes with a number of built-in skins:

>note The **Hay** , **Forest** , **Sitefinity** and **Transparent** skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of **Q1 2014** .	You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
