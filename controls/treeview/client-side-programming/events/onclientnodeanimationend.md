# OnClientNodeAnimationEnd



## 

The __OnClientNodeAnimationEnd__ event fires when the node is expanded / collapsed and after the animation has finished.

The event handler has two parameters:

1. The treeview instance that fired the event.

1. Event arguments with functions:

* __get_node()__ retrieves a reference to the node being toggled.

* __get_expanding()__ returns true if the node is expanded and false if it collapsed.
