# Skins



Skins control the overall look and feel of a __RadRotator__object. By using Skins consistently, you can make your rotators fit in with the design of the rest of a Web site, increasing usability and attractiveness.

Specify the skin to use by setting the __Skin__ property of the __RadRotator__object. You can override this default skin by setting the __Skin__ property on an individual __RadRotator__object.

__RadRotator__ is installed with a number of preset skins:![RadRotator Skins](images/rotator-skins_thumb.png)

>note The __Hay__ , __Forest__ , __Sitefinity__ and __Transparent__ skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of __Q1 2014__ .You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
