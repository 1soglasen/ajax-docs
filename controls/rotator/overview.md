# Rotator Overview



## 

__Telerik RadRotator for ASP.NET AJAX__is a flexible UI component for content rotation and personalization. The control is completely rewritten (compared to RadRotator for ASP.NET) and offers many improvements in data binding and control's handling.

RadRotator for ASP.NET AJAX is completely customizable in terms of appearance and offers numerous configuration options like:

* __ScrollDirection__ - specifies possible directions for scrolling rotator frames. This property can take as value any combination of the Up, Down, Left and Right values.

* __[RotatorType]({%slug rotator/functionality/radrotator-types%})__ - specifies the type of rotator [how the rotator will render and what options the user will have for interacting with it on the client]. Possible values for this property are: AutomaticAdvance, Buttons, FromCode.

* __ScrollDuration__ - specifies the speed in milliseconds for scrolling rotator frames.

* __WrapFrames__ - when set to true, this property configures the RadRotator to start scrolling the rotator frames from the beginning, once the rotator shows the last frame.



__Telerik RadTicker for ASP.NET AJAX__ is a control that displays text by outputting only a single character of the text per given interval, thus simulating a "typewriter" effect on the screen. A Ticker may consist of multiple RadTickerItems. When the end of the current item is reached, the ticker continues on the next line.
