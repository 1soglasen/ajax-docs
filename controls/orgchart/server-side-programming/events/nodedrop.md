# NodeDrop



## 

The __NodeDrop__ is raised when a Node is dragged and dropped on non-child Node.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the orgchart firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following properties:

* __DestinationNode__ - the Node on which the dragged Node is dropped.

* __SourceNode__ - the dropped Node.
