# Skins



## 

To make customizing the appearance of __RadOrgChart__ as easy as possible, the control uses predefined skins. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheets that can be applied to the elements (nodes, images, etc.) of the control and thus define their look and feel. To apply a skin to the __RadOrgchart__, set its Skin property, either using the properties pane or the RadOrgChart Smart Tag.

The control comes with a number of built-in skins:![Skins](images/radorgchart-skins.png)
