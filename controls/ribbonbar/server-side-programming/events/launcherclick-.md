# LauncherClick 



## 

The server-side __LauncherClick__ event occurs when a group launcher is clicked, causing a postback.

The event handler function receives two arguments:

1. The __RadRibbonBar__ which has fired the event. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadRibbonBar type__.

1. An EventArgs object with __Group__ property providing access to the group of the clicked launcher.

The following example demonstrates how to use the LauncherClick event to determine the group of the clicked launcher.

````C#
	
	    protected void RadRibbonBar1_LauncherClick(object sender, RibbonBarLauncherClickEventArgs e)
	    {
	        string message = string.Format("Launcher of group {0} was clicked.", e.Group.Text);
	
	        textBox1.Text = message;
	    }

		Protected Sub RadRibbonBar1_LauncherClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RibbonBarLauncherClickEventArgs)
			Dim message As String = String.Format("Launcher of group {0} was clicked.", e.Group.Text)
	
			textBox1.Text = message
