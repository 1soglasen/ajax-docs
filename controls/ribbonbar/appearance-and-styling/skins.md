# Skins



## 

To make customizing the appearance of __RadRibbonBar__ as easy as possible, the control uses __predefined skins.__ A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheets that can be applied to the elements (items, images, etc.) of the control and thus define their look and feel. To apply a skin to the ribbonbar, set its __Skin__ property, either using the properties pane or the __RadRibbonBar__[ Smart Tag ]({%slug ribbonbar/design-time%}).

The control comes with a number of built-in skins:![RibbonBar Skins](images/ribbonbar_skins_thumb.png)

>note The __Hay__ , __Forest__ , __Sitefinity__ and __Transparent__ skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of __Q1 2014__ .	You can find more information on the matter in[this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
