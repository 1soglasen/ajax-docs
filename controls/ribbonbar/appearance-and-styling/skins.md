To make customizing the appearance of **RadRibbonBar** as easy as possible, the control uses **predefined skins.** A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheets that can be applied to the elements (items, images, etc.) of the control and thus define their look and feel. To apply a skin to the ribbonbar, set its **Skin** property, either using the properties pane or the **RadRibbonBar** [ Smart Tag ]({%slug ribbonbar/design-time%}).

>note The **Hay** , **Forest** , **Sitefinity** and **Transparent** skins are obsolete and have been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI.Skins.dll assembly as of **Q1 2014**.	You can find more information on the matter in [this blog post](http://blogs.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/posts/13-04-11/6-telerik-asp.net-ajax-skins-going-obsolete).
