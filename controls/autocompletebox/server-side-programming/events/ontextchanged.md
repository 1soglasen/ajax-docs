# OnTextChanged



## 

The __TextChanged__ event occurs when the text is changed and InputType="Text" is set for RadAutoCompleteBox.

The __TextChanged__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadAutoCompleteBox__ object. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadAutoCompleteBox__ type.

1. An AutoCompleteTextEventArgs object. This object has a __Text__ property of type string.
