# OnEntryAdded



## 

The __EntryAdded__ event occurs when an entry is added and InputType="Token" is set for RadAutoCompleteBox.

The __EntryAdded__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadAutoCompleteBox__ object. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadAutoCompleteBox__ type.

1. An AutoCompleteEntryEventArgs object. This object has an __Entry__ property of type AutoCompleteBoxEntry.

	Label1.Text = e.Entry.Text + " was added.";
}

````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub RadAutoCompleteBox1_EntryAdded(sender As Object, e As AutoCompleteEntryEventArgs)
	Label1.Text = e.Entry.Text + " was added."
