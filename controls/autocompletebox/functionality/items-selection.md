# Items Selection



## 

Items present in the drop-down container of RadAutoCompleteBox can be selected using both the mouse, or the keyboard.

When the user starts to type in the input area, the items present in the drop-down container are filtered against the typed text. Only the items which satisfy the filter criteria are visible in the drop-down container that pops up. When the drop-down list is visible, the user can use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys, or the mouse, to go throught the filtered items and look for an item to select.An item from the drop-down container can be selected more than once.

RadAutoCompleteBox gives the users the ability to create entries which text does not match any of the items present in the drop-down container. This functionality is enabled by the **AllowCustomEntry** property of RadAutoCompleteBox,which takes a boolean as a value.
