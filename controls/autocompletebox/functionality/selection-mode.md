In order to use the single selection mode you will need to have set the __InputType__ property of the RadAutoCompleteBox to __Text__. With __single selection__RadAutoCompleteBox becomes a single input searchbox, which is a widely used scenario. In single selection mode the user can freely type any characters inside the input and no additional editing is done to the text. The filtering is based on the whole text. At any point the get_text() method can be called to obtain the text of the AutoCompleteBox. For consistency, in this mode the __EntriesCollection__ will have __only one Entry__, which will contain the whole text.

There are two values that can be set with the __TextSettings-SelectionMode__ property - __Single__ and __Multiple__. When no Selection Mode (__TextSettings-SelectionMode__) is set, the default value is __Multiple__.

Either of the two approaches below can be applied:

````ASPNET
	   <telerik:RadAutoCompleteBox runat="server" ID="RadAutoCompleteBox1" InputType="Text">
	                <TextSettings SelectionMode="Single" />
	            </telerik:RadAutoCompleteBox>
````



````ASPNET
	       <telerik:RadAutoCompleteBox runat="server" ID="RadAutoCompleteBox1" InputType="Text" TextSettings-SelectionMode="Single">
	        </telerik:RadAutoCompleteBox>
````



On the __client-side__ you easily set or get the selection mode using the *__set_selectionMode()__* and *__get_selectionMode()__* properties.
