Example:

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadGrid ID="RadGrid1" runat="server">
	        <ClientSettings>
	            <Resizing AllowRowResize="true" />
	            <ClientEvents OnRowResized="RowResized" />
	        </ClientSettings>
	    </telerik:RadGrid>
````



````JavaScript
	        function RowResized(sender, eventArgs) {
	            var e = eventArgs.get_domEvent();
	            alert("Row instance: " + eventArgs.get_itemIndexHierarchical() + "  was resized");
	        }
````



>note get_gridDataItem() is not directly available on the client unless OnRowCreating/OnRowCreated events are hooked up. This is done for optimization purpose. If you need the rowIndex, you can use eventArgs.get_itemIndexHierarchical()
