# Traversing Items in Group Panel



## 

You can iterate through the items placed in the group panel of a grid and modify their settings. This can be done quite easily using the __PreRender__ event of the grid. The items in the group panel can be accessed using the __RadGrid.GroupPanel.GroupPanelItems__ collection.

The following example illustrates how this is done. It changes the __ImageUrl__ for the sorting image button of each group panel item and set its __CausesValidation__ property to __false__ (to avoid validation on click):

	    protected void RadGrid1_PreRender(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
	    {
	        foreach (TableCell cell in RadGrid1.GroupPanel.GroupPanelItems)
	        {
	            foreach (Control ctrl in cell.Controls)
	            {
	                if (ctrl is ImageButton)
	                {
	                    ImageButton button = ctrl as ImageButton;
	                    button.ImageUrl = "<my_img_url>";
	                    button.CausesValidation = false;
	                }
