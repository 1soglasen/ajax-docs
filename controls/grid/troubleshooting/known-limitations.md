# Known Limitations

Grid Limitations

For convenience, this topic summarizes the current RadGrid limitations and unsupported scenarios from all of the topics to forewarn the developer in an early stage of the implementation process.

__ViewState__

Some functionalities are not supported when the __EnableViewState__ property of RadGrid is set to __False__. A throughout explanation can be found in the [Optimizing ViewState usage]({%slug grid/performance/optimizing-viewstate-usage%}) topic.

__Grouping__

When paging is enabled and the last group continues on the next pages, the group aggregates will calculate only the content of the visible items on the current page, and not of the total group records.

__Paging__

Autogenerated hierarchy with paging is not supported.

__Editing__

Currently, using __Popup Edit Form__ when both grouping and scrolling are enabled is not supported in RadGrid due to a browser limitation.

__Filtering__

* __GridDropDownColumn__ - RadGrid does not include any support for filtering by __ListTextField__. This limitation is because the filtering mechanism relies on the __DataField__ of the filtered column and for __GridDropDownColumn__ this property specifies the mapping field in the drop-down source.

__MultiColumn Headers__

The functionalities listed below are officially not supported with multicolumn headers:

* Frozen Columns;

* Show/Hide on the client;

__Dragging on Mobile__

On mobile devices the row drag-drop and scrolling features in the grid are performed by the same touch gesture: dragging of the content area of the grid. This imposes a limitation when both features are enabled on touch devices because it cannot be exclusively determined which one of the two should be performed. One way to distinguish between scrolling and row drag-drop on mobile devices is to use a GridDragDropColumn - this way the dragging of the rows will be performed only when you drag a row by the icon in the GridDragDropColumn and on the rest of the content area scrolling will be performed.

__Client Side Data-binding__

Basically, a grid bound using client side data-binding improves the performance of RadGrid. However, there are certain limitations, due to this client side model. These are listed below:

* __Data editing and grid editors__ - since the control is bound on the client, and no subsequent trips are made to the server, the default editors cannot be rendered, and shown, which is the standard behavior, when the grid is bound on the server.

* __Hierarchical structures__ - with the client side data binding approach for the grid, there is no out-of-the-box support for hierarchical structures.

* __Grouping__ with client-side binding is not supported. Server binding only should be used in order to achieve grouping.

* __Sorting/Filter expressions__ - with the standard server side data-binding of the grid control, one could declare/set filter and sorting expressions, which would then be applied to the control - for example declaratively in the aspx markup, or dynamically, in the code-behind section. When using client side data-binding, the same logic can be executed, but in a slightly different manner. The filter/sorting expression can be passed to the relevant page method, which would in turn use it to return the proper data.

__ModelBinding__

We do not support model binding when the __ViewState__ of the page is disabled. In order to use the model binding you need to set __Page.EnableViewState = “true”__

__Frozen Columns__

There are several limitations that you should have in mind. They are caused by the complexity and specifics of the frozen columns feature, which is implemented by means of hiding and showing columns, instead of actually scrolling them.

* __Resizing__ with frozen column is not supported.

* __Having hidden columns__ (with __Display__ property set to __false__) or hiding/showing columns and frozen columns are not supported at the same time. Hidden columns reappear after scrolling.

* __Merged headers__ with frozen columns are not supported.

* When frozen columns are used, __tabbing between the textboxes__ in an inline edit form is not supported out-of-the-box, because the frozen columns will be scrolled together with the non-frozen. In selected scenarios, this functionality can be achieved if you subscribe to the textboxes' focus events and scroll a specific <div> with Javascript. This <div> has a client ID of "...___Frozen__" where "..." is the RadGrid client ID. When doing this, you should take into account the current scroll position, and the width of the column that should be hidden/shown.

* __OnScroll__ client-side event does not fire when horizontal scroll is used for scrolling.

* Frozen columns are not supported for __detail tables__ of hierarchy grid.

__Exporting__

__PDF:__

Although we are striving to constantly improve our products, there are some limitations in the current implementation of our PDF engine:

* __OnGridExporting__ - this event is useable in many scenarios when you want to modify the output file - for example you may want to add some custom information above RadGrid or when you want to remove/add/replace parts of the content. The only limitation applies to the PDF export because by the time the __OnGridExporting__ event is raised, the PDF is already generated. For more information, please visit the dedicated [PDF format]({%slug grid/functionality/exporting/export-formats/pdf-export%}) topic which introduces the __OnPdfExporting__ event that is designed specifically for this format.

* Image transparency

* Right-to-left fonts

* Nested DIV elements with absolute position

* Nested DIV elements with specified width or height

* Automatic text clipping

* Client-side binding

* Medium trust

__ExcelML:__

* When exporting RadGrid with grouping, all groups will be expanded regardless of their actual state.

__Biff:__

* Hierarchy

* Grouping

* Automatic column/row resizing

* Active links

__HTML-Based:__

* Embedded images are not supported

* Exporting invisible RadGrid - to avoid problems with missing content, you should temporarily show RadGrid before export

* __OpenOffice__, __AbiWord__, etc. don't support this standard so they won't show the files properly

* In theory all __Microsoft Office__ versions from __2000__ up might work, although we don't guarantee that any version, prior to __2003__ will display the __Office HTML__ formats as expected

__Excel Format (HTML-Based):__

It is expected to receive the following warning when opening the generated __xls__ file in __Microsoft Office 2007__:

* The file you are trying to open, 'Filename.xls', is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening this file. Do you want to open the file now? *

__CSV:__

* Hierarchical structure

* Grouping

* Exporting invisible RadGrid

__Other__

__Column's UniqueName and DataField:__

The DataField and the UniqueName of a column must contain only letters, numbers and "_". Following the conventions, variables could not start with a numberand having auto-generated columns where the column names have a numeric prefix could lead to numerous problems and is not supported scenario.
