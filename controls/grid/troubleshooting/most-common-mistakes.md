# Most Common Mistakes



This help article describes seven common mistakes that customers make using RadGrid and offers solutions to the problems.

## 1. Incorrect Structure of Columns or DetailTables.

In order for __RadGrid__ to work properly, it is very important to build the grid structure correctly. When you create thestructure using the designer (in Visual Studio) there is less of a chance that mistakes will be made. The more difficult and error-prone task iscreating the structure programmatically. Since __RadGrid__ saves all of its structure properties(__DetailTables__, __Columns__, etc.) into the ViewState, building a __RadGrid__dynamically is a task very similar to creating and adding controls dynamically to a web page.

See [http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/25/TRULY-Understanding-Dynamic-Controls-_2800_Part-1_2900_.aspx](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/25/TRULY-Understanding-Dynamic-Controls-_2800_Part-1_2900_.aspx)

The following two scenarios offer possible approaches to dynamically create a __RadGrid__ that ensure that__RadGrid__ will behave normally.

## 1st Scenario:

You can create the __RadGrid__ instance and the grid structure in the __Page.Init__ event handler.Then the instance of __RadGrid__ is added to the controls collection of the Page. In this case, no __ViewState__is required for the grid structure to be persisted because it is recreated on each page initialization. There are no other special requirementsin this case.

````C#
	
	this.RadGrid1 = new RadGrid();
	
	this.RadGrid1.NeedDataSource += new GridNeedDataSourceEventHandler(this.RadGrid1_NeedDataSource);
	this.RadGrid1.DetailTableDataBind += new GridDetailTableDataBindEventHandler(this.RadGrid1_DetailTableDataBind);
	
	this.RadGrid1.CssClass = "RadGrid";
	
	this.RadGrid1.Width = Unit.Percentage(100);
	this.RadGrid1.PageSize = 5;
	this.RadGrid1.AllowPaging = true;
	this.RadGrid1.AutoGenerateColumns = false;
	this.RadGrid1.GroupingEnabled = true;
	this.RadGrid1.ShowGroupPanel = true;
	this.RadGrid1.ClientSettings.AllowDragToGroup = true;
	
	this.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.DataMember = "Customers";
	this.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.PageSize = 15;
	
	GridBoundColumn boundColumn;
	boundColumn = new GridBoundColumn();
	boundColumn.DataField = "CustomerID";
	boundColumn.HeaderText = "CustomerID";
	this.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Columns.Add(boundColumn);
	....
	//Add to page controls collection
	this.PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add( RadGrid1 );          
````



````VB.NET
	Me.RadGrid1 = new RadGrid();
	
	AddHandler Me.RadGrid1.NeedDataSource, New GridNeedDataSourceEventHandler(AddressOf Me.RadGrid1_NeedDataSource)
	AddHandler Me.RadGrid1.DetailTableDataBind, New GridDetailTableDataBindEventHandler(AddressOf Me.RadGrid1_DetailTableDataBind)
	
	Me.RadGrid1.CssClass = "RadGrid"
	
	Me.RadGrid1.Width = Unit.Percentage(100)
	Me.RadGrid1.PageSize = 5
	Me.RadGrid1.AllowPaging = true
	Me.RadGrid1.AutoGenerateColumns = false
	Me.RadGrid1.GroupingEnabled = true
	Me.RadGrid1.ShowGroupPanel = true
	Me.RadGrid1.ClientSettings.AllowDragToGroup = true
	
	Me.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.DataMember = "Customers"
	Me.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.PageSize = 15
	
	Dim column1 As New GridBoundColumn
	boundColumn.DataField = "CustomerID"
	boundColumn.HeaderText = "CustomerID"
	Me.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Columns.Add(boundColumn)
	
	    '...
	‘Add to page controls collection
	Me.PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add( RadGrid1 )</pre>
	          
````


>end

## 2nd Scenario

You can add __RadGrid__ to the page using the designer, but create the structure programmatically in the__Page.Load__ event handler. In this scenario, the structure should be built only where __Page.IsPostBack__is __false__. You should also add the instances of any created objects, such as columns and detail tables, to the__RadGrid__ before any of those object’s properties have been set. This is important because no __ViewState__is managed for the object before it has been added to the corresponding collection.

Example:

>tabbedCode

````C#
	
	    private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
	    {
	        if (!IsPostBack)
	        {
	            GridBoundColumn boundColumn;
	            //Important: first Add column to the collection
	            boundColumn = new GridBoundColumn();
	            this.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Columns.Add(boundColumn);
	            //Then set properties
	            boundColumn.DataField = "CustomerID";
	            boundColumn.HeaderText = "CustomerID";
	        }
	    }
````



````VB.NET
	    Private Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
	        If Not IsPostBack Then
	            Dim column1 As New GridBoundColumn
	            'Important: first Add column to the collection
	            Me.RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Columns.Add(column1)
	            'Then set properties
	            column1.DataField = "CustomerID"
	            column1.HeaderText = "CustomerID"
	        End If
	    End Sub
````


>end

## 2. Misusing or Not Using NeedDataSource Event

The __NeedDataSource__ event helps you easily control events like paging, sorting, and grouping, with__RadGrid__. Using these types of __PostBack__ events, which __RadGrid__ fires, canlead to a change in the __Items__ collections of each __GridTableView__ in a __RadGrid__.A structural change here means that items should be recreated. In order to achieve that, the __RadGrid__ should have a__DataSource__ assigned and the __DataBind()__ method should be called. Then, instead of writing all the code to handle the appropriate scenario, you can just let RadGrid handle these changes internally and only handle __NeedDataSource__,which fires at the exact time the items should be recreated.

>important You should avoid using the __NeedDataSource__ event handler to change the structure of an instance of __RadGrid__ . If it is necessary to change the structure, you may need to use the event argument object to check the reasonthat __NeedDataSource__ was being fired. Also, the developer should not call the __DataBind()__ method inthe __NeedDataSource__ event handler. It will be called internally when needed.
>


Often developers do not realize that __NeedDataSource__ is called only when __RadGrid__ "knows" aboutthe structural changes, such as when a sort or page command is executed. In all other cases, when you make changes to the structure of the gridthat require binding, you should call the __Rebind()__ method. This method will first check if the__DataSource__ has been assigned, then it will force the RadGrid instance to fire __NeedDataSource__and then __DataBind()__. You can find more information about using __NeedDataSource__ and when thisevent fires in this [online demo](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/Programming/NeedDataSource/DefaultCS.aspx)

## 3. Using EnableViewState = false in Non-supported Scenarios

See [Switching off RadGrid's viewstate ]({%slug grid/performance/optimizing-viewstate-usage%}) topic for details aboutthe __EnableViewState__property.

## 4. Using Cell Numeric Index to Find a Cell in a GridItem Instead of Using Item's String Index by Column.UniqueName

One of the major differences between __RadGrid__ and the standard .NET __DataGrid__ control is thedynamic column structure of __RadGrid__. Unlike the __DataGrid__, __RadGrid__ supportsoperations such as column reordering and grouping which alter the __Cells__ collection of __GridItem__objects in a way that can’t be predicted by the page developer. For example, when using a __DataGrid__, many developers used tosearch a cell in an item using the following code:

>tabbedCode

````C#
	item.Cells[4]          
````



````VB.NET
	item.Cells(4)
````


>end

However, imagine that the user has changed the column order using a client-side drag-and-drop operation. Then the cell with index 4 will no longerrefer the same field value. That's why __RadGrid__ provides the ability to access cells in items using the correspondingcolumn’s __UniqueName__. For example, if you have a column with the unique name "CustomerID" you can find the correspondingcell in a __GridItem__ using:

>tabbedCode

````C#
	item.Cells["CustomerID"] 
	//for GridDataItem you can replace that with
	item["CustomerID"]          
````



````VB.NET
	    item.Cells("CustomerID")
	    'for GridDataItem you can replace that with
	    item("CustomerID")
````


>end

This will prevent you from accessing the wrong cell.

## 5. Finding Controls Inside RadGrid

You should note the following about searching for controls in an item that is in edit mode. Unlike the __DataGrid/GridView__control, __RadGrid__ supports the __EditForms__ feature that is set by default. It alters the "traditional"editing style by displaying an edit form item (row), below the item currently being edited, instead displaying the in-place editors. That is why,if you have template columns for example, and you have to search for a control that is in the edit template, you should search the__EditFormItem__ instead of the edited item. This item is accessible using the__GridDataItem.EditFormItem__ property.

Additional details can be found in these help resources:

[InPlace editing]({%slug grid/data-editing/edit-mode/in-place%})[EditForms editing]({%slug grid/data-editing/edit-mode/edit-forms%})[Custom edit forms]({%slug grid/data-editing/edit-mode/custom-edit-forms%})

## 6. Overusing Hierarchical Structure in TreeView Style Scenarios

To better understand how __RadGrid__ deals with hierarchy, refer to the article: [Understanding hierarchical grid structure]({%slug grid/hierarchical-grid-types-and-load-modes/understanding-hierarchical-grid-structure%}).

__RadGrid__supports hierarchical database structure or building hierarchy through self-referencing source table (having ID->ParentID relations in the same DataTable). This means that with [standard hierarchy](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/hierarchy/declarativerelations/defaultvb.aspx), in each level of hierarchy, all items will have an equal number of details tables (one or[several in the same level]({%slug grid/hierarchical-grid-types-and-load-modes/several-tables-at-a-level%})).

This is unlike the __RadTreeView__ control which supports different number of sub-items on each level - the equivalent in thiscase is __RadTreeList__ control that allows you to have variable number of nested sub-tables in each level. Refer to[this online demo](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/treelist/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx) for further reference.

>note Note that __RadGrid__ will not behave correctly if you add detail tables programmatically in __DetailTableDataBind__ event handler.
>


## 7. Comman Mistakes When Handling the ItemDataBound or ItemCreated Events.

__ItemDataBound__ and __ItemCreated__ event handler allows you to manipulate the controls and the	values of each cell in __RadGrid__. The differences between those two events is discussed thoroughlyin	[this topic]({%slug grid/control-lifecycle/differences-between-itemcreated-and-itemdatabound-%}). When handling __ItemCreated__ and	__ItemDataBound__ events, forgetting to check for the appropriate:

* __GridItemType__ - At the following [article](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/t_telerik_web_ui_griditemtype.html)you can find a list with all available item types.

* Detail table in the hierarchical structure - This check can be done using: __- e.Item.OwnerTableView.DataMember__ property (.NET 2.x when not using data source controls)__- e.Item.OwnerTableView.DataSourceID__(.NET 2.x/3.x/4.x with data source controls) or__-e.Item.OwnerTableView.Name__ (.NET 2.x/3.x/4.x)where __e__ is the event parameter of the event handler method. This way you can avoid possible problems when performing customization of items specific to a certain level of the hierarchy.A code sample is available in [this section]({%slug grid/hierarchical-grid-types-and-load-modes/how-to/distinguish-grid-rows-in-hierarchy-on-itemcreated/itemdatabound%}) of the help as well.
