# Server-Side Programming Overview



## Classes and Properties

Following is a table of the most important properties you should be aware of when working with RadGrid.


|  __Property__  |  __Description__  |
| ------ | ------ |
| __RadGrid.MasterTableView__ |The main grid table - in the general case, when there is no hierarchy, only __RadGrid.MasterTableView__ is rendered. You can think of this table as if it is the grid itself. __MasterTableView__ and generally all table-views in the hierarchy use the style, client behavior and other settings applied to __RadGrid__ , unless explicitly specified otherwise.|
| __GridTableView.DetailTables__ |This collection is used for defining the hierarchical structure of __RadGrid__ .|
| __RadGrid.ClientSettings__ |Set various client-side appearance and behavior options. See[RadGridTable client-side API]({%slug grid/client-side-programming/overview%})for details.|
| __RadGrid.*Style__ |Properties that control the visual appearance of __RadGrid__ and all tables in the hierarchy.|
| __GridDataTable.*Style properties__ |Properties that control the visual appearance of __GridDataTable__ and all tables in the hierarchy.|
| __GridTableView.ColumnGroups__ |A collection of type GridColumnGroupCollection which holds the multiheaders in the GridTableView|
| __GridTableView.GroupByExpressions__ |Add or remove objects to this collection to set grouping programmatically.|
| __GridTableView.SortExpressions__ |Add or remove objects to this collection to set sorting programmatically.|
| __GridTableView.Columns__ , __GridTableView.AutoGeneratedColumns__ , __GridTableView.RenderColumns__ |Properties to access runtime columns. Columns are set by default in design mode. __AutoGeneratedColumns__ - are automatically generated columns __RenderColumns__ - all columns - columns+ AutoGenerated (if any) + structure columns - expand/collapse and group-splitters|

>note Instead of setting properties for each GridTableView, you can use RadGrid global properties for: PageSize, AllowSorting, AllowPaging, AllowCustomPaging, ShowFooter, ShowHeader, BackColor, BorderColor, PagerStyle. Thus they will be set for each table in the hierarchy, unless specified otherwise.

## Events

When working with Telerik RadGrid you will probably often use the following events:


|  __Category__  |  __Event__  |  __Description__  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| __Action__ | __CancelCommand__ |Fired when the __Cancel__ button is clicked for an item in the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __DeleteCommand__ |Fired when the __Delete__ button is clicked for an item in the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __EditCommand__ |Fired when the __Edit__ button is clicked for an item in the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __UpdateCommand__ |Fired when the __Update__ button is clicked for an item in the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __InsertCommand__ |Fired when the __Insert__ button is clicked for an item in the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __ItemCommand__ |Fired when any button is clicked in the __RadGrid__ control. All bubbled events from grid items fire __RadGrid.ItemCommand__ . Those like - Edit, Delete, or Update command events can be used to handle custom data-editing in __RadGrid.__ Expand/Collapse items in the hierarchy or __GridGroupHeaderItem__ -s (if grid displays grouped items), also fired after binding of detail tables, etc.|
|| __SortCommand__ |Fired when a column is sorted. To determine the new/previous sort order on sort command, check the values for the __e.NewSortOrder__ and __e.OldSortOrder__ arguments.|
|| __PageIndexChanged__ |Fired when one of the page selection elements is clicked.|
|| __PageSizeChanged__ |Fired when the page size is changed through the advanced pager or manually in code|
|| __SelectedIndexChanged__ (inherited from __GridBaseDataList__ )|Fired when a different item is selected in a data listing control between posts to the server.|
|| __NeedDataSource__ |Fired when __RadGrid__ needs a data source for rebinding.|
|| __GroupsChanging__ |Fired when Telerik RadGrid tries to group its data (e.g. when a column header is dragged to the Group Panel).|
| __Behavior__ | __ItemCreated__ |Fired on the server when an item in the __RadGrid__ control is created.|
|| __ItemDataBound__ |Fired after an item is databound to the __RadGrid__ control.|
|| __ItemEvent__ |Marked for internal usage.|
|| __ColumnCreated__ |This event is fired __after__ the creation of auto-generated columns.|
|| __ColumnCreating__ |Fires __before__ a custom column is created. You can handle the event to replace or modify the instance of the column that should be created and added into the collection of column in the corresponding __GridTableView__ .|
|| __CreateColumnEditor__ |Fired -after- the __NeedDataSource__ event of the grid (which is raised right after the __PageLoad__ event) and -before- any postback events for controls on the page/user control.|
|| __ColumnsReorder__ |Fired when column reorder occurs (only when __ClientSettings -> ReorderColumnsOnClient__ is set to false!)|
| __Data__ | __DataBinding__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired right before the server control binds to a data source. This event will fire only once, when __RadGrid__ is initially binding.|
|| __DataBound__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when the server control is bound to a data source.|
|| __DetailTableDataBind__ |Fired when a table from __DetailTablesCollection__ binds to a data source.|
| __Automatic data editing operations__ | __ __ItemDeleted__ __ |Fired when an automatic delete operation is executed.|
|| __ __ItemUpdated__ __ |Fired when an automatic update operation is executed.|
|| __ __ItemInserted__ __ |Fired when an automatic insert operation is executed.|
| __Row drag/drop__ | __ __RowDrop__ __ |Fired when drag and drop operation is triggered from the client|
| __Export__ | __OnGridExporting__ |Fired when RadGrid is exported to Excel/Word/Csv/Pdf before the resulting document is rendered on the client.|
|| __OnPdfExporting__ |Fired when RadGrid is exported to Pdf before the resulting document is rendered on the client. Appropriate for customizing the grid table appearance in the .pdf document.|
|| __OnExcelExportCellFormatting__ |Fired when RadGrid is exported to Excel before the resulting document is rendered on the client.|
|| __OnExcelMLExportStylesCreated__ |Fired when RadGrid is exported to native Excel before the OnExcelMLExportRowCreated event.|
|| __OnExcelMLExportRowCreated__ |Fired when RadGrid is exported to native Excel before the resulting document is rendered on the client.|
| __Misc__ | __Disposed__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when a server control is released from the memory, which is the last stage of the server control lifecycle when an ASP.NET page is requested.|
|| __Init__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when the server control is initialized, which is the first step in its lifecycle.|
|| __Load__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when the server control is loaded into the __RadGrid__ object.|
|| __PreRender__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when the server control is about to render to its containing __Page__ object.|
|| __Unload__ (inherited from __Control__ )|Fired when the server control is unloaded from the memory.|

>note RadGrid's ColumnCreating event is fired only for custom columns that inherit one of RadGrid's column types. Additionally, as this event is fired very early in RadGrid's lifecycle, it will not fire if the custom user-created column is placed declaratively in the .aspx page, as the markup is parsed at a later stage.
>Another peculiarity to note, is that the ColumnCreating event will fire only after a postback. It will not fire on initial page load (IsPostBack = false). The explanation for this is that the event is designed to service any needs to restore custom column properties from the viewstate or other source. Where these column properties are initially set when defining the custom column, this is not the case when the page posts back and RadGrid needs to load its properties from the viewstate. This is where the ColumnCreating event comes in, giving the ability to manually restore custom properties for the column.
