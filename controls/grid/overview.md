# Grid Overview


Telerik **RadGrid** is designed to eliminate the typical trade off associated with ASP.NET grid controls — rich functionality at the expense of weight and performance. Thanks to its innovative architecture, **RadGrid** is extremely fast and generates very little output. Added to this is true cross-browser support — Internet Explorer, all Gecko-based browsers, and Opera.

At the same time, **RadGrid** delivers top-of-the line features.
