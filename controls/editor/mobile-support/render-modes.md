# Render Modes

**RadEditor** has two different render modes that can change the actual HTML markup that is rendered.	They are exposed via the **RenderMode** property that can have four	possible values - **Classic**, **Lightweight**, **Mobile** and **Auto**.	This functionality was introduced in the **Q3 2014** version.

The possible options are:

* **Classic**—this mode is the rendering that has been used before. It remains without changes and it is the default value of the property.	In this mode tables and background images (in several sprites) are used to create	the layout (including rounded corners and shadows).

* **Lightweight**—this mode emphasizes on semantic HTML and CSS3. It reduces the amount of markup the control renders	and makes it easier to customize. This also reduces the number of image sprites required by the control and the other controls from the suite it uses.	All of this decreases the overall size and complexity of each skin, including custom ones.

* **Mobile**—this mode is currently not supported. If you set it, the mode will fall back automatically to **Lightweight**.

* **Auto**—this mode makes each control choose the appropriate rendering mode according to the used	browser—**Classic** or **Lightweight**. This functionality was added in Q3 2013.

>important RadEditor and its child controls (RadWindow and RadToolBar), as well as the other controls included in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite that utilize render modes, support only one type of render mode per page.This includes mode being set for a standalone RadEditor, RadToolBar, RadWindow and RadWindowManager. All such controls must have the same RenderMode on a given page. This also includes instances from user controls and master pages.



>note The RibbonBar ToolbarMode is supported only with the RadEditor's Classic rendering mode.


## Setting Render Mode

There are two ways to configure the rendering mode of the controls:

* The **RenderMode property** in the markup or in the code-behind that can be used for a particular instance:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadEditor ID="RadEditor1" runat="server" RenderMode="Lightweight">
</telerik:RadEditor>
````


````C#
RadEditor1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight;
````
````V	
RadEditor1.RenderMode = Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode.Lightweight	
````


* A **global setting in the web.config** file that will affect the entire application, unless a concrete value is specified for a given control instance:

````XML
<appSettings>
	<add key="Telerik.Web.UI.Editor.RenderMode" value="lightweight" />
</appSettings>
````
