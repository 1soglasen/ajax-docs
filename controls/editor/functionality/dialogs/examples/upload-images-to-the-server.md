# Upload Images to the Server



## 

RadEditor has built-in support for uploading/deleting/inserting images. The developer can allow end-users to upload, insert and delete images in the folder structure of the web-application by setting the followingproperties:

For example, to enable users to upload images in the "~/Images" folder and all of its subfolders, you need to set the ImageManager-ViewPaths, ImageManager-UploadPaths, and ImageManager-DeletePaths properties as follows:

There are two approaches to set the Image Manager's paths:

````XML
	     <telerik:RadEditor ID="RadEditor1" runat="server"
	         ImageManager-ViewPaths="~/Images"
	         ImageManager-UploadPaths="~/Images"
	         ImageManager-DeletePaths="~/Images" >
	     </telerik:RadEditor>
````



````XML
		  <telerik:RadEditor ID="RadEditor1" runat="server">
	         <ImageManager
	             ViewPaths="~/Images"
	             DeletePaths="~/Images"
	             UploadPaths="~/Images" />
	     </telerik:RadEditor>
````



````C#
	     
	string[] imagepath = {"~/Images"};
	RadEditor1.ImageManager.UploadPaths = imagepath;
	RadEditor1.ImageManager.ViewPaths = imagepath;
	RadEditor1.ImageManager.DeletePaths = imagepath; 		
````



````VB.NET
	
		Dim imagepath() As String = {"~/Images"}
		RadEditor1.ImageManager.UploadPaths = imagepath
		RadEditor1.ImageManager.ViewPaths = imagepath
		RadEditor1.ImageManager.DeletePaths = imagepath 
	
````



>note Note that the imagepath variable is an array of strings and that the Images folder must be:
>
* a subdirectory of your web application or
* a virtual directory of your web application that has a physical path pointing outside of your web application.
* a shared drive that is a virtual folder of your web application.>You should also grant full __ASPNET__ (WinXP) / __NETWORK SERVICE__ (Win 2003 and Vista) account permissions to the Images Folders.
