# RadButton Not Performing Postback



## 

Sometimes you may encounter a scenario in which the __RadButton__ controldoesn’t trigger postback and is rendered as an input HTML element of type button. Most probably thisbehavior is caused by a validation control on the page, containing the __RadButton__.

For example you can take the following situation – a page with ASP TextBox and a RequiredFieldValidator, attached to that textbox. The page is submitted via __RadButton__, which hasdefault settings. Below is the markup of the described page:

````ASPNET
		<asp:TextBox ID="NameInput" runat="server" />
		<asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="RequiredNameValidator" ControlToValidate="NameInput"
				runat="server" Display="Dynamic" />
		<telerik:RadButton ID="btnSubmit" runat="server" Text="Submit">
		</telerik:RadButton>
````



In some cases the validation requirements are not met and the __RadButton__doesn’t initiate postback, which may cause confusion if the validation is not easy to spotand the button is not supposed to be part of it.

If you want to exclude the __RadButton__ from the validation mechanism of the page, you can set its	[CausesValidation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.button.causesvalidation.aspx)property to __false__ (this is also valid for a regular Button control).
