# Keyboard Support


A critical requirement for software accessibility is keyboard support as a complete alternative to pointing devices (mouse, etc.). Keyboard support is comprised of command key, focus key, and keyboard navigation. **RadNavigation** seamlessly switches between mouse and keyboard navigation.

Setting the control's **KeyboardNavigationSettings**, allows you to associate an activation combination (**CommandKey** + **FocusKey**), which moves focus to the Navigation's first node and enables keyboard navigation. When there are multiple **RadNavigation** controls on a given page, each of them may have a different activation combination.

## Keyboard Navigation Settings

The **KeyboardNavigationSettings** exposes two properties to configure the keyboard combination that sets focus to the control: 

* **CommandKey**: [Ctrl] , [Alt] or [Shift].

* **FocusKey**: An upper-case letter or number.

Pressing **CommandKey** + **FocusKey** sets the focus on the **RadNavigation**'s first node and enables keyboard navigation. 

>note In the browsers certain keyboard combinations are reserved and used as shortcuts.
