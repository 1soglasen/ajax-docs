# OnItemDataBound



The following article demonstrates the usage of the server-side event __OnItemDataBound__.

## 

The __ItemDataBound__ event occurs for each item that is added to the Items collection of the __SearchContext__ when it is bound. This event only occurs if the items are loaded from a data source (the DataSource or DataSourceID property is set). The event handler receives two parameters:

* __The SearchContext__ that is loading items. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the SearchContext type.

* A __SearchBoxContextItemEventArgs__ object. This object has an Item property, which provides access to the item that was just bound. This item has a DataItem property, which lets you access the item in the data source, to which the __SearchContextItem__ is being bound.

__Example 1__: Demonstrates how to use the __ItemDataBound__ event handler, in order to set the __ImageUrl__ property of the __SearchContextItem__.
