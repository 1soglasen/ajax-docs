# OnAjaxSettingCreated



The __AjaxSettingCreated__ event occurs after an AjaxSetting is
added to the RadAjaxManager __AjaxSettings__ collection. The event
can be triggered by the AjaxSettings configured at design time, as they are
instantiated, or at run-time after AddAjaxSetting() is called.The
event cannot be canceled.

The __AjaxSettingCreated__ event handler receives two
arguments:

1. The __RadAjaxManager__ control that owns the AjaxSettings collection that the setting is being added to. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadAjaxManager__ type.

1. And __AjaxSettingCreatedEventArgs__ object with the following properties:

* __Initiator__: A reference to the object that triggered the AJAX request.

* __Updated__: A reference to the object that will be updated by the AJAX request.

* __UpdatePanel__: A reference to the underlying MS AJAX UpdatePanel.
