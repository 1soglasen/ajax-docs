# OnAjaxSettingCreating



The __AjaxSettingCreating__ event occurs just before an AjaxSetting is added to the RadAjaxManager __AjaxSettings__ collection. The event can be triggered by the AjaxSettings configured at design time, as they are about to be instantiated, or at run-time in response to AddAjaxSetting(). The event can be cancelled.

The __AjaxSettingCreating__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadAjaxManager__ control that owns the AjaxSettings collection that the setting is being added to. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadAjaxManager__ type.

1. An __AjaxSettingCreatingEventArgs__ object with the following properties:

* __Canceled__: This boolean property can be set true to abandon creating the AjaxSetting and will prevent the [OnAjaxSettingCreated]({%slug ajax/server-side-programming/events/onajaxsettingcreated%}) event from firing.

* __Initiator__: A reference to the object that triggered the AJAX request.

* __Updated__: A reference to the object that will be updated by the AJAX request.

* __UpdatePanel__: A reference to the underlying MS AJAX UpdatePanel.
