# MediaPlayer Overview



## 

Q3 2013 release of UI for ASP.NET AJAX introduces the highly requested RadMediaPlayer - a video/audio player supporting HTML5 media formats and offering tight integration with media providers, such as YouTube.

RadMediaPlayer uses the build-in HTML5 <video> and <audio> element functionality to bring powerful media capabilities to your apps without the necessity of installing additional plug-ins. It provides a quick and easy to setup way to deliver rich media web experience for websites, blogs, online TV channels, e-commerce pages, etc.

For older browsers which don't support HTML5 natively, Internet Explorer 8 and 7 in particular, the player provides a Flash fallback method to play the video or audio file by rendering a Flash object.![Media-Player-Overview-Image](images/mediaplayer-overview-image.png)
