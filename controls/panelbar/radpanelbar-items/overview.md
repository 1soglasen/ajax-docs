# RadPanelBar Items Overview



## The properties of panel items

The items of __RadPanelBar__ have a few important properties, which are listed below:

* __Text__ is the text of the item as it appears in the panel bar.

* __ToolTip__ is the text of a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the mouse over the item.

>note Setting the tooltip can enable an accessibility feature: Special accessibility readers like JAWS can pronounce the tooltip of the highlighted item.
>


* __Enabled__ controls whether the item is enabled or disabled.

* __IsSeparator__ specifies whether the panel item [acts as a separator]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/separators%}).

* __Expanded__ specifies whether the item is expanded.

* __PreventCollapse__ specifies whether the user can collapse the item once it is expanded.

* __Selected__ specifies whether the item is selected.

* __Value__ lets you associate a text value with the panel item that you can use when programming the panel bar behavior.

* __NavigateUrl__ and __Target__ cause the panel item to automatically launch another Web page (specified by __NavigateUrl__) in the window specified by __Target__. If the __Target__ property is not set, the new Web page uses the current browser window.

* __PostBack__ specifies whether the item causes a postback.

* __CssClass__, __ClickedCssClass__, __DisabledCssClass__, __ExpandedCssClas__, and __FocusedCssClass__[control the appearance of the panel item]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/setting--the-css-class-of-items%}) when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, and holds input focus, respectively.

* __ImageUrl__, __SelectedImageUrl__, __DisabledImageUrl__, __ExpandedImageUrl__, and __HoveredImageUrl__ let you [specify an image]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-items%}) that appears on the left of the panel item when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, and when the mouse hovers over it, respectively.
