# Accessing Client Changes on the Server





Client side changes are available on the server side after postback. You can use the __ClientChanges__ property of RadPanelBar to access them. The ClientChanges property of RadPanelbar returns a collection of objects of type __ClientOperation__.An operation has two properties:

* __Item__ - the item which has been affected by the client operation;

* __Type__ - the type of the operation which is one of the following four cases:

* __Update__ - when a property is set on the the client through methods such as __set_text__(), __set_value__(), __enable__(), __disable__(), etc.: panelbarItem.disable();

* __Remove__ - when the __remove__ client method is called: panelbar.get_items().remove(panelbarItem);

* __Insert__ - when the __add__client method is called: panelbar.get_items().add(panelbarItem);

* __Clear__ - when an item with child items calls the __clear__() method: parentItem.get_items().clear(). If the parent item has no child items the ClientChanges collection is not altered.

>note Note that you need to call the __trackChanges__ () and __commitChanges__ () client methods of RadPanelBar in order to be able to access the changes on the server via the __ClientChanges__ property.

## Example:

The code snippet below enumerates through all operations in the ClientChanges collection and utilizes both the __Item__ and __Type__ properties. For a complete demo, please see the client-side [Add/Remove/Disable Items](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Panelbar/Examples/ClientSide/ClientSideAPI/DefaultCS.aspx) example.
