**RadPanelBar** introduces three server-side events for working with panel items:

* [ItemClick]({%slug panelbar/server-side-programming/itemclick%}) occurs when the user clicks on a panel item.

* [ItemCreated]({%slug panelbar/server-side-programming/itemcreated%}) occurs when a new panel item is added to the panel bar (at any level).

* [ItemDataBound]({%slug panelbar/server-side-programming/itemdatabound%}) occurs when a panel item is bound to a data source.
