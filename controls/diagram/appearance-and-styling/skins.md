## 

__RadDiagram__ uses __skins__ to control its overall look-and-feel. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheetthat can be applied to the control elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their appearance.

To apply a skin to a __RadDiagram__ control, set its __Skin__ property.

__RadDiagram__ is installed with a number of preset skins. These are shown below:
