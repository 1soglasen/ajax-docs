# Events Overview



## 

__RadWizard__ provides a rich set of client-side events which allow easy and flexible use in a wide range of application scenarios. In this article you will find examples about each of these events, demonstrating how to handle and cancel them (if possible):

* __[OnClientLoad]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/load%})__—raised when the __RadWizard__ client-side object is fully loaded. The full API of the control is available at this point.

* __[OnClientButtonClicking]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/buttonclicking%})__—raised when user clicks on a button or step before the __RadWizard__ responds to the click. You can handle this event in case you want to prevent the click.

* __[OnClientButtonClicked]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/buttonclicked%})__—raised occurs immediately after the __RadWizard__ responds to button or step click.
