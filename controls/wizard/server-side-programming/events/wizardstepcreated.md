# WizardStepCreated



## 

The server-side __OnWizardStepCreated__ event occurs when a RadWizardStep object is created.

The __OnWizardStepCreated__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadWizard__ that contains the active step. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadWizard__ type.

1. A __WizardStepCreatedEventArgs__ object. This object has a property __RadWizardStep__ that you can use to access the wizard step that was created.

Use the __OnPreviousButtonClick__ event handler to respond when a RadWizardStep object is created.
