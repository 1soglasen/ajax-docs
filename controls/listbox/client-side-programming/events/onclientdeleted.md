# OnClientDeleted

## 

The __OnClientDeleted__ Client-side event occurs after the item or items have been deleted.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __get_items()__ - returns an array of the deleted items

* __get_item()__ - returns the item that was deleted

* __get_domEvent()__ - returns the DOM event object

The example below shows how to alert the user that the item was successfully deleted:

````JavaScript	
function onClientDeletedHandler(sender, e) {
	alert("Successfully deleted: " + e.get_item().get_text());
}				
````
