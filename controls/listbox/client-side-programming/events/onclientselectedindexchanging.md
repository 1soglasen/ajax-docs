# OnClientSelectedIndexChanging

## 

The __OnClientSelectedIndexChanging__ client-side event occurs when the selected item is about to be changed. This event can be cancelled.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __get_item()__ - returns the item that is about to be selected.

* __set_cancel()__ - lets you cancel the event and prevent items from being selected.

* __get_domEvent()__ - returns the DOM event object

The example below shows how to ask the user before selecting the item:

````JavaScript	
function onClientSelectedIndexChangingHandler(sender, e) {
	if (!confirm("Are you sure?")) {
		e.set_cancel(true);
	}
}
````
