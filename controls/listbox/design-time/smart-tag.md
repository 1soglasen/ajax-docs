Using the unbound __RadListBox__ Smart Tag you can perform the following:

## RadListBox Tasks

* __Choose Data Source__ lets you bind RadListBox declaratively by selecting a data source from a drop-down list of all available data source components. If you select __<New Data Source...>__ the standard Windows [Data Source Configuration Wizard](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247282(VS.80).aspx) appears, where you can create and configure a data source component.

* __Build RadListBox__ opens the [RadListBox Item builder]({%slug listbox/design-time/item-builder%}), where you can add static items to the ListBox and set their properties.

* __Add RadListBox__ adds another RadListBox on the page related to the first one. Use this when you want to [transfer items]({%slug listbox/functionality/transfer%}) between two RadListBox controls.

* __Skin__ lets you select from a list of available [skins]({%slug listbox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look of your __RadListBox__.

## Learning Center

## Edit Templates

Clicking the __Edit Templates__ link brings up a [template editor]({%slug listbox/design-time/template-editor%}) where you can customize the Item Template.

## Smart Tag of bound RadListBox

When __RadListBox__ is bound to a data source, the Smart Tag looks like the following:

![Bound Smart Tag](images/listbox_bound_smart_tag.png)

Using the Smart Tag of bound __RadListBox__ lets you perform any task you can perform with the Smart Tag of unbound RadListBox. In addition, you can choose __Configure Data Source...__ to open the standard [Data Source Configuration Wizard](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247282(VS.80).aspx), where you can configure the currently bound data source component.

Once the Data Source is chosen, you can select each of the following: __DataKeyField__, __DataSortField__, __DataTextField__ and __DataValueField__. These should be fields in the Data Source which will serve data respectively for the primary key, sort order column and __Text__ and __Value__ properties of RadListBox Items.
