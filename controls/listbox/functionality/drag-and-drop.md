# Drag and Drop



## 

__RadListBox__ fully supports [reordering]({%slug listbox/functionality/reorder%}) and [transferring]({%slug listbox/functionality/transfer%}) of Items through __drag-and-drop__.

You could enable the functionality by first configuring the corresponding RadListBox(es) to allow Reorder and/or Transfer and then setting the __EnableDragAndDrop__ property to __true__.

In addition to all corresponding events that fire on Reorder/Transfer RadListBox supports a few solely drag-and-drop events.

At the client, these are:

* [OnClientDragStart]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdragstart%}) - fires when the drag-and-drop operation starts. Can be canceled.

* [OnClientDragging]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdragging%}) - fires while an Item is being dragged. Can be canceled.

* [OnClientDropping]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdropping%}) - fires before the dragged Item is dropped. Can be canceled.

* [OnClientDropped]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdropped%}) - fires after the dragged Item is dropped.



After a successful drop the corresponding Reorder and Transfer client-side events fire.

At the server, the Reorder or Transfer events fire only if the __AutoPostBackOnReorder__ or __AutoPostBackOnTransfer__ properties are set to __true__.

Finally, the server-side [Dropping]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/dropping%}) and [Dropped]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/dropped%}) events fire only if the dragged Items are dropped onto an __HTML element__, which is __not__ an Item and has its __id__ attribute set.
