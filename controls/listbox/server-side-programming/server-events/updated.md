# Updated



## 

The __Updated__ event fires after the [Updating]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/updating%}) event (if not cancelled) and after the database has been updated (if __AllowAutomaticUpdates="True"__)



The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __Items__ - collection of all __RadListBoxItem__ objects which will be affected by the reordering. This collection is __different__ from the Items collection in the Reordering/Reordered events
