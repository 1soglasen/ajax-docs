# Transferred

## 

The __Transferred__ event fires after the [Deleted]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/deleted%}) event. The __Items__ collection of the listbox is updated to reflect the transferring.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __Items__ - collection of __RadListBoxItem__ objects which were transferred.


````C#
protected void SourceListBox_Transferred(object sender, RadListBoxTransferredEventArgs e)
{
	Label.Text += e.Items.Count.ToString() + " items are transferred";
}
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub SourceListBox_Transferred(sender As Object, e As RadListBoxTransferredEventArgs)
	Label.Text += e.Items.Count.ToString() + " items are transferred"
End Sub
````
