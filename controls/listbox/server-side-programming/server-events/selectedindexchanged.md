## 

The __SelectedIndexChanged__ fires when you change the selected item. It will fire automatically if the __AutoPostBack="True".__The event fires before the [TextChanged]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/textchanged%}) server event.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing no methods
