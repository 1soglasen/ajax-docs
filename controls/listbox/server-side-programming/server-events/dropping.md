# Dropping

## 

The __Dropping__ server event fires just before a RadListBoxItem is dropped over an __HTML element__ which has __id__ attribute set. The event can be cancelled. It is __not fired__ when you drop an item over another RadListBox/RadListBoxItem.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __HtmlElementID__ - the ID of the target element which the item is dropped over.

* __Cancel__ - set it to True to cancel the event and prevent the dropping

* __SourceDragItems__ - a collection of RadListBoxItems which are about to be dropped

````C#
protected void RadListBox_Dropping(object sender, RadListBoxDroppedEventArgs e)
{
	if (TextBox1.ClientID != e.HtmlElementID)
	{
		e.Cancel = true;
	}
} 
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub RadListBox_Dropping(sender As Object, e As RadListBoxDroppedEventArgs)
	If TextBox1.ClientID <> e.HtmlElementID Then
		e.Cancel = True
	End If
End Sub
