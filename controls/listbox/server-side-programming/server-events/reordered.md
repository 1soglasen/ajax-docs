# Reordered



## 

The __Reordered__ event fires after the [Updated]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/updated%}) event. The __Items__ collection of the listbox is updated to reflect the reordering.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __Items__ - collection of __RadListBoxItem__ objects which were reordered.



````C#
	    protected void RadListBox1_Reordered(object sender, RadListBoxEventArgs e)
	    {
	        foreach (RadListBoxItem item in e.Items)
	        {
	            item.Text = "Reordered Item";
	        }
	    }
````
````VB.NET
	    Protected Sub RadListBox1_Reordered(sender As Object, e As RadListBoxEventArgs)
	        For Each item As RadListBoxItem In e.Items
	            item.Text = "Reordered Item"
	        Next
	    End Sub
