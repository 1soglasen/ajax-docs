# Transferring



## 

The __Transferring__ server event fires when the __AutoPostBackOnTransfer="True"__and the user tries to transfer an item / items__.__ It fires __before__ the [Deleting]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/deleting%}) server event (if not cancelled) once for all selected items. If this event is not cancelled and the __AllowAutomaticUpdates="True"__ - the database is updated to reflect the new reordered list.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* __Items__ - collection of all __RadListBoxItem__ objects which will be affected by the transfer.

* __Cancel__ - set it to True to cancel the event and prevent the transfer to happen



````C#
	    protected void SourceListBox_Transferring(object sender, RadListBoxTransferringEventArgs e)
	    {
	        e.Cancel = true;
	    }
````
````VB.NET
	    Protected Sub SourceListBox_Transferring(sender As Object, e As RadListBoxTransferringEventArgs)
	        e.Cancel = True
	    End Sub
	#End Region
	End Class
