# ItemCreated



## 

The __ItemCreated__event occurs for each new item that is added to the __Items__ collection of the RadListBox.

>note If the item is added from a data source (the __DataSource__ or __DataSourceID__ property specifies the source of the items), it is a good idea to use the[ItemDataBound](4F4B15B3-7C02-4BAF-A1E1-27F089C40A92)event instead. __ItemCreated__ occurs before the __ItemDataBound__ event (before any item properties have been set to reflect the data in the data source).
>


The __ItemCreated__event handler receives two arguments:

* The __RadListBox__ that is loading items. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadListBox__ type.

* An EventArgs object of type __RadListBoxItemEventArgs__. This object has an __Item__ property, which provides access to the item that has just been added.
