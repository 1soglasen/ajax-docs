## 

To make customizing the appearance of __RadTagCloud__ as easy as possible, these control uses skins. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that are applied to the HTML elements which make up the tagcloud control, defining the look and feel.

To apply a skin, set the Skin server-side property of the control. You can set it in the markup, by using the properties pane or the control's Smart Tag.

__RadTagCloud__ is installed with a number of predefined skins:
