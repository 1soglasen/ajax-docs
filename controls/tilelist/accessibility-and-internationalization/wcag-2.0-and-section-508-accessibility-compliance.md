# WCAG 2.0 and Section 508 Accessibility Compliance



## 

Telerik's __TileList__ control satisfies the requirements of __Section 508__ and those for__Level A__ according to the __W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0__.

__RadTileList__is tested with the __WAVE__ and __Compliance Sheriff__ automated tools.

By itself, __RadTileList__ generates as little markup as possible.When creating content, the developer should make sure that content is accessible to persons with disabilities. This is most important for[Live Tiles]({%slug tilelist/tiles/live-tile/overview%}),[ContentTemplate Tiles]({%slug tilelist/tiles/contenttemplate-tile%}) and the[PeekTemplate]({%slug tilelist/tiles/peek-template%}) where the entire content is designed by the developer.
