# What is Zone



## 

__RadFormDecorator__ can style the empty area on the page that has no controls but empty space or generic HTML tags like spans or divs - color and background color are applied. This special area is called __"Zone"__ and developers can have control over it (set whether it will be decorated or not) through __DecoratedControls__ and __ControlsToSkip__ properties of the FormDecorator.

There are four Skins (__Black, Forest, Office2010black__ and __Office2010Silver__) which can decorate the __"Zone"__ by applying background-color, and color. The following example shows full decoration on the page (the Label element and the Zone) with the "Forest" Skin:

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadFormDecorator runat="server" ID="rfd1" Skin="Forest" DecoratedControls="All" />
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <label>
	        Simple Label</label>
	    <br />
	    <asp:Label runat="server">ASP Label</asp:Label>
````

The following example shows decoration only on the simple Label element (Zone is excluded from decoration) with the "Forest" Skin:

````ASPNET
	    <telerik:RadFormDecorator runat="server" ID="RadFormDecorator1" Skin="Forest" DecoratedControls="All"
	        ControlsToSkip="Zone" />
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    <label>
	        Simple Label</label>
	    <br />
	    <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server">ASP Label</asp:Label>
````

>note In both examples only the HTML Label is decorated, as the ASP Label is not rendered as a Label but <span> element.
