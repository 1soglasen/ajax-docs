# Server-side Selection



There might be scenarios where you need to perform server-side selection for the RadTreeList items.For that purpose, you can use one of the below approaches:

* Add a __TreeListSelectColumn__ and provide the ability to the user toselect the desired items through it.

* Use server-side code to programmatically select the treelist items.

In both cases, to enable multi-item selection, you need to set the RadTreeList__AllowMultiItemSelection__ property to __true__.

## Using the TreeListSelectColumn

RadTreeList server-side selection is enabled for the users once you add the__TreeListSelectColumn__ to the RadTreeList Columns collection. You do not need toset any additional properties. Then checking the checkbox rendered in the column marks the correspondingitem as selected. As a result, postback is performed and the __ItemCommand__ eventis fired with command name __RadTreeList.SelectCommandName__. To deselect an item,one should uncheck the checkbox in the select column. Then again postback is performed and theItemCommand event is fired with command name __RadTreeList.DeselectCommandName__.

	        ParentDataKeyNames="ReportsTo" AllowMultiItemSelection="True" OnItemCommand="RadTreeList1_ItemCommand">

	    protected void RadTreeList1_ItemCommand(object sender, Telerik.Web.UI.TreeListCommandEventArgs e)
	    {
	        if (e.CommandName == RadTreeList.SelectCommandName)
	        {
	            //item is being selected    
	        }
	        if (e.CommandName == RadTreeList.DeselectCommandName)

	        }

	        If e.CommandName = RadTreeList.SelectCommandName Then
	            'item is being selected    
	        End If
	        If e.CommandName = RadTreeList.DeselectCommandName Then
	            'item is being deselected    
	        End If
	    End Sub

## Programmatic items selection

To select an item/items with server-side code, you can set the particular item/items__Selected__ property to __true__:



````C#
	    protected void Page_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)
	    {
	        TreeListDataItem item = RadTreeList1.Items[0];
	        item.Selected = true;
	    }			
````
````VB.NET
	    Protected Sub Page_PreRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Me.PreRender
	        Dim item As TreeListDataItem = RadTreeList1.Items(0)
	        item.Selected = True
	    End Sub
````


## Deselecting items programmatically

To deselect an item/items programmatically, set its __Selected__ property to __false__.

You can also call the __ClearSelectedItems()__ method of the RadTreeList controlto deselect all selected items which are visible on the current page.
