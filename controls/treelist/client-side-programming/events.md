# Events



This topic will introduce you to the client-side events of the **RadTreeList** control - which are the available events to handle and how to subscribe to them. Further information about each event can be read by following the links provided in the table below.

## Attaching event handlers

You can execute code on a certain event in the treelist by attaching a function to the event in the ClientSettings-ClientEvents tag of the control:

````JavaScript
	        <telerik:RadTreeList ID="RadTreeList1" runat="server" DataKeyNames="EmployeeID" ParentDataKeyNames="ReportsTo"
	            DataSourceID="SqlDataSource1" AutoGenerateColumns="true">
	            <ClientSettings>
	                <ClientEvents OnTreeListCreated="TreeListCreated" />
	            </ClientSettings>
	        </telerik:RadTreeList>
````



Handlers can also by attached dynamically using code, for example:

````JavaScript
	        function TreeListCreated(sender, eventArgs) {
	            var treelist = sender;
	            treelist.add_itemClick(ItemClick);
	        }
````



Here the event name is formed from the names in the table below by removing *On* and starting with a small letter.
