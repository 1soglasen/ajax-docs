## 

The following table lists the most important methods of the client-side __RadDockZone__ object:


>caption Â 

|  __Name__  |  __Parameters__  |  __Return Type__  |  __Description__  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| __clone__ |string|Telerik.Web.UI.RadDockZone|Clones the current __Telerik.Web.UI.RadDockZone__ object. Accepts as parameter the string that will be set to the __UniqueId__ of the cloned object. Returns the cloned __Telerik.Web.UI.RadDockZone__ object.|
| __dock__ |([RadDock]({%slug dock/client-side-programming/raddock-object%})) or (RadDock, integer)|none|Docks the specified __RadDock__ control in this docking zone.If called with one parameter, the __RadDock__ control is docked in the last position. If called with a second (index) parameter, the __RadDock__ control is docked in the specified (0-offset) position.	Keep in mind that the behavior of RadDock, docked via this method, will be slightly different if it is already placed inside the RadDockZone control. For example, if a RadDock is positioned with index 0, its location will not change if the index, specified in the __dock__ method, is 0 or 1. This occurs, because the dock control is inserted before the RadDock with the specified index.	In order to ensure that the behavior will be the same, when a RadDock control is already docked inside a RadDockZone, please call the RadDock client-side method __undock__ before __dock__ .|
