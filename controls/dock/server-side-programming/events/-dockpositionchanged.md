#  DockPositionChanged



## 

The __DockPositionChanged__ event occurs when postbacks are enabled and the user changes the position of a __RadDock__ control. This change can be

* A move from one __RadDockZone__ control to another.

* A move from a __RadDockZone__ control to a floating position.

* A move from a floating position to a __RadDockZone__ control.

* A change of index within a __RadDockZone__ control.

>note The __DockPositionChanged__ event does *not* occur when the __RadDock__ control is moved from one floating position to another, or when the __RadDock__ control is moved programmatically.
>


The __DockPositionChanged__event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadDock__ control whose position has changed.

1. A __DockPositionChangedEventArgs__ object. This object has two properties describe the new position of the __RadDock__ object:

* __DockZoneID__ is the __ID__ of the new __RadDockZone__ to which the control is moved. If the __RadDock__ control is moved to a floating position, __DockZoneID__ is null.

* __Index__ is the new index of the __RadDock__ control in the __RadDockZone__ identified by __DockZoneID__. If the __RadDock__ control is moved to a floating position, __Index__ is -1.

* __IsDragged__ determines whether the position of the __RadDock__ control is changed as a result of dragging. If the position of the dock control is changed because another one is closed or moved out of the __RadDockZone__, __IsDragged__ will be set to __false__.

In the __DockPositionChanged__ event handler, the __DockZoneID__ and __Index__ properties of the __RadDock__ control reflect the old position from which the __RadDock__ control is being moved. This is true even if the event handler is called after a delay because the value of the __AutoPostBack__ property is __False__.

Use a __DockPositionChanged__ event handler to respond when the user moves the __RadDock__ control:

	    protected void RadDock1_DockPositionChanged(object sender, DockPositionChangedEventArgs e)

	            dock.Text = String.Format("I used to be in {0} but now I am floating.", dock.DockZoneID);
