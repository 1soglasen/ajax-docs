# Command



## 

The __Command__ event occurs when postbacks are enabled and the user clicks on one of the command icons in the __RadDock__ title bar.

The __Command__ event handler receives two arguments:

1. The __RadDock__ control whose title bar contains the command icon that the user clicked. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadDock__ type.

1. A __DockCommandEventArgs__ object. This object has a __Command__ property, that provides access to the __DockCommand__ object for the command that was clicked:

Use a __Command__ event handler to provide a server-side implementation for custom commands or to augment the default behavior of built-in commands. For example, the following Command event handler implements a custom command that moves a docked control to the next docking position if it is not the last docked control in its parent's docking zone:
