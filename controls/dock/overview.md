The __TelerikDocking controls__ consist of __RadDock__, __RadDockZone__, and __RadDockLayout__.

* A[client-side API]({%slug dock/client-side-programming/overview%}) that includes the ability to manipulate __RadDock__ controls in the same way the user can move them with the mouse and numerous [client-side events]({%slug dock/client-side-programming/events/overview%}) to respond to user actions.

* The ability to customize the [drag-and-drop behavior]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}) of individual __RadDock__ controls,including specifying the __DockHandle__ that the user clicks on to start a drag operation and controlling where the user can drop a control.

* Support for adding [Commands]({%slug dock/commands/overview%}) to the __RadDock__ title bar and implementing their behavior in a variety of [events]({%slug dock/commands/events-triggered-on-command-execution%}).
