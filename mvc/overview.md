# MVC Overview



This article explains which Telerik products can be used in an ASP.NET MVC environment.

## ASP.NET MVC Basics

__ASP.NET MVC__ enables you to build Model View Controller (MVC) applications by using the ASP.NET framework. ASP.NET MVC is an alternative, not a replacement, for ASP.NET Web Forms that offers the following benefits:

* Clear separation of concerns

* Testability - support for Test-Driven Development

* Fine-grained control over HTML and JavaScript

* Intuitive URLs

## Telerik and ASP.NET MVC

We recommend using the[UI for ASP.NET MVC, the Telerik product built from the ground up to support the principles of MVC development](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc)in your MVC projects.

The Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite is not tested under MVC environments and the controls from the AJAX suite are not supported in an MVC setup.They are based on the web form paradigm and heavily rely on the web form server lifecycle that is not available in an MVC environment.You can only add the AJAX controls to a standard web form in an MVC project. The Razor engine is not supported by the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls.
